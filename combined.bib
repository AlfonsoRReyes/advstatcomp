abstract ={The accuracy of published medical research is critical for scientists, physicians and patients who rely on these results. However, the fundamental belief in the medical literature was called into serious question by a paper suggesting that most published medical research is false. Here we adapt estimation methods from the genomics community to the problem of estimating the rate of false discoveries in the medical literature using reported $P$-values as the data. We then collect $P$-values from the abstracts of all 77é430 papers published in The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, The British Medical Journal, and The American Journal of Epidemiology between 2000 and 2010. Among these papers, we found 5322 reported $P$-values. We estimate that the overall rate of false discoveries among reported results is 14% (s.d. 1%), contrary to previous claims. We also found that there is no a significant increase in the estimated rate of reported false discovery results over time (0.5% more false positives (FP) per year, $P = 0.18$) or with respect to journal submissions (0.5% more FP per 100 submissions, $P = 0.12$). Statistical analysis must allow for false discoveries in order to make claims on the basis of noisy data. But our analysis suggests that the medical literature remains a reliable record of scientific progress.},

title = {Mortality in COPD: Role of comorbidities},
abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents an increasing burden throughout the world. COPD-related mortality is probably underestimated because of the difficulties associated with identifying the precise cause of death. Respiratory failure is considered the major cause of death in advanced COPD. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and lung cancer are also major causes and, in mild-to-moderate COPD, are the leading causes of mortality. The links between COPD and these conditions are not fully understood. However, a link through the inflammation pathway has been suggested, as persistent low-grade pulmonary and systemic inflammation, both known risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer, are present in COPD independent of cigarette smoking. Lung-specific measurements, such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), predict mortality in COPD and in the general population. However, composite tools, such as health-status measurements (e.g. St George's Respiratory Questionnaire) and the BODE index, which incorporates Body mass index, lung function (airflow Obstruction), Dyspnoea and Exercise capacity, predict mortality better than FEV(1) alone. These multidimensional tools may be more valuable because, unlike predictive approaches based on single parameters, they can reflect the range of comorbidities and the complexity of underlying mechanisms associated with COPD. The current paper reviews the role of comorbidities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality, the putative underlying pathogenic link between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and comorbid conditions (i.e. inflammation), and the tools used to predict chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality.},

title = {Why are patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases? The potential role of systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease 2- to 3-fold. The factors responsible for this association remain largely unknown.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data from participants, > or =50 years of age, of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n=6629) to determine whether C-reactive protein (CRP) and other systemic inflammatory markers are present in participants with chronic airflow obstruction and are associated with cardiac injury. Participants with severe airflow obstruction had circulating leukocyte, platelet, and fibrinogen levels that were 460/ microL (95% confidence interval [CI], 30 to 890/ microL), 39 510/ microL (95% CI, 21 730 to 57 290/ microL), and 41.63 mg/dL (95% CI, 19.87 to 63.39 mg/dL) higher, respectively, than in those without airflow obstruction. They were also 2.18 times (95% CI, 1.46 to 3.27) more likely to have an elevated circulating CRP level. Moderate airflow obstruction was associated with smaller but still significant increases in these levels. Moderate and severe airflow obstruction was associated with increased occurrence of ischemic changes on electrocardiograms of participants. In the presence of both highly elevated CRP and moderate or severe airflow obstruction, the Cardiac Infarction Injury Score was 2.68 and 5.88 U higher, respectively, than in those without airflow obstruction and with low CRP, which suggests an additive effect of CRP and COPD on the risk of cardiac injury.

CONCLUSION: Low-grade systemic inflammation was present in participants with moderate to severe airflow obstruction and was associated with increased risk of cardiac injury. This may in part explain the high rates of cardiovascular complications in COPD.},

title = {Impaired lung function and mortality risk in men and women: findings from the Renfrew and Paisley prospective population study},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and subsequent mortality.

DESIGN: Prospective general population study.

SETTING: Renfrew and Paisley, Scotland.

SUBJECTS: 7058 men and 8353 women aged 45-64 years at baseline screening in 1972-6.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mortality from all causes, ischaemic heart disease, cancer, hung and other cancers, stroke, respiratory disease, and other causes of death after 15 years of follow up.

RESULTS: 2545 men and 1894 women died during the follow up period. Significant trends of increasing risk with diminishing FEV1 are apparent for both sexes for all the causes of death examined after adjustment for age, cigarette smoking, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol concentration, body mass index, and social class. The relative hazard ratios for all cause mortality for subjects in the lowest fifth of the FEV1 distribution were 1.92 (95% confidence interval 1.68 to 2.20) for men and 1.89 (1.63 to 2.20) for women. Corresponding relative hazard ratios were 1.56 (1.26 to 1.92) and 1.88 (1.44 to 2.47) for ischaemic heart disease, 2.53 (1.69 to 3.79) and 4.37 (1.84 to 10.42) for lung cancer, and 1.66 (1.07 to 2.59) and 1.65 (1.09 to 2.49) for stroke. Reduced FEV1 was also associated with an increased risk for each cause of death examined except cancer for lifelong nonsmokers.

CONCLUSIONS: Impaired lung function is a major clinical indicator of mortality risk in men and women for a wide range of diseases. The use of FEV1 as part of any health assessment of middle aged patients should be considered. Smokers with reduced FEV1 should form a priority group for targeted advice to stop smoking.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hospitalized patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), when routinely evaluated for pulmonary embolism (PE), show PE in 25-29% of cases. We assessed the rate of diagnosis of PE and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalized patients with COPD and the influence of age on relative risk compared with hospitalized patients who do not have COPD.

METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of data in hospitalized adults with and without COPD from the National Hospital Discharge Survey.

RESULTS: From 1979 to 2003, 58,392,000 adults 20 years of age and older, were hospitalized with COPD in the United States. Among these patients, PE was diagnosed in 381,000 (0.65%) and DVT in 632,000 (1.08%). The relative risk of PE in adults hospitalized with COPD was 1.92 and for DVT it was 1.30. Relative risks were age dependent. Among those aged 20-39 years with COPD, the relative risk of PE was 5.34. Among patients aged 40-59 years, the relative risk of PE decreased to 2.02, and among patients aged 60-79 years the relative risk of PE was 1.23.

CONCLUSION: These data, when compared with the rate of diagnosis of PE in hospitalized patients with exacerbations of COPD, all of whom were evaluated for PE, indicate that PE in patients with COPD is generally underdiagnosed. In young adults, other risk factors in combination with COPD are uncommon, so the contribution of COPD to the risk of PE becomes more apparent than in older patients.},

abstract = {Inflammation plays a major role in atherothrombosis, and measurement of inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) may provide a novel method for detecting individuals at high risk of plaque rupture. Several large-scale prospective studies demonstrate that HSCRP is a strong independent predictor of future myocardial infarction and stroke among apparently healthy men and women and that the addition of HSCRP to standard lipid screening may improve global risk prediction among those with high as well as low cholesterol levels. Because agents such as aspirin and statins seem to attenuate inflammatory risk, HSCRP may also have utility in targeting proven therapies for primary prevention. Inexpensive commercial assays for HSCRP are now available; they have shown variability and classification accuracy similar to that of cholesterol screening. Risk prediction algorithms using a simple quintile approach to HSCRP evaluation have been developed for outpatient use. Thus, although limitations inherent to inflammatory screening remain, available data suggest that HSCRP has the potential to play an important role as an adjunct for global risk assessment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.},

title = {Impaired flow-mediated dilation is associated with low pulmonary function and emphysema in ex-smokers: the Emphysema and Cancer Action Project (EMCAP) Study},
abstract = {RATIONALE: Basic science research suggests a causal role for endothelial dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical studies examining endothelial function are lacking, particularly early in the disease. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is a physiologic measure of endothelial reactivity to endogenous nitric oxide.

OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that lower FMD among former smokers would be associated with lower post-bronchodilator FEV(1), higher percentage of emphysema using computed tomography (CT) and lower diffusing capacity.

METHODS: We measured FMD, pulmonary function, and CT percentage of emphysema in a random sample of 107 cotinine-confirmed former smokers in the ongoing EMCAP study. FMD was defined as percentage change in the brachial artery diameter with reactive hyperemia. Generalized additive models were used to adjust for potential confounders and assess linearity.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 71 +/- 5 years, 46% were female, and pack-years averaged 48 +/- 26. Mean FMD was 3.8 +/- 3.1%; mean post-bronchodilator FEV(1), 2.3 +/- 0.8 L; and mean CT percentage of emphysema, 26 +/- 10%. A 1 SD decrease in FMD was associated with a 132-ml (95% confidence interval, 16-248 ml; P = 0.03) decrement in post-bronchodilator FEV(1) and a 2.6% (95% confidence interval, 0.5-4.7%; P = 0.02) increase in CT percentage of emphysema in fully adjusted models. These associations were linear across the spectrum from normality to disease, independent of smoking history, and also significant among participants without COPD. Associations with diffusing capacity were consistent but nonsignificant (P = 0.09). The FMD-FEV(1) association was entirely attributable to percentage of emphysema.

CONCLUSIONS: Impaired endothelial function, as measured by FMD, was associated with lower FEV(1) and higher CT percentage of emphysema in former smokers early in COPD.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Conditions that give rise to reduced lung function are frequently associated with low-grade systemic inflammation, which may lead to poor cardiovascular outcomes. We sought to determine the relationship between reduced FEV1 and cardiovascular mortality, independent of smoking.

DESIGN: Longitudinal population-based study and a meta-analysis of literature.

SETTING: Representative sample of the general population.

PARTICIPANTS: Participants of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study who were 40 to 60 years of age at baseline assessment (n = 1,861).

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We compared the risk of cardiovascular mortality across quintiles of FEV1. Individuals in the lowest FEV1 quintile had the highest risk of cardiovascular mortality (relative risk [RR], 3.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54 to 7.34). Compared to FEV1 quintile 1, individuals in quintile 5 had a fivefold increase in the risk of death from ischemic heart disease (RR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.26 to 14.13). We also performed a systematic review of large cohort studies (> 500 participants) that reported on the relationship between FEV1 and cardiovascular mortality (12 studies; n = 83,880 participants). Compared to participants in the highest FEV1 category, those with reduced FEV1 had a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (pooled RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.56 to 1.97).

CONCLUSIONS: There is strong epidemiologic evidence to indicate that reduced FEV1 is a marker for cardiovascular mortality independent of age, gender, and smoking history.},

title = {Increased heart rate and reduced heart-rate variability are associated with subclinical inflammation in middle-aged and elderly subjects with no apparent heart disease},
abstract = {AIM: Elevation of inflammation markers, high heart rate, and reduced heart-rate variability are all strong markers of mortality in a broad spectrum of patients. The association between these markers has not been clarified thoroughly. We investigated the associations between markers of inflammation, heart rate, and heart-rate variability.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Six hundred and forty-three healthy men and women between 55 and 75 years of age and with no prior history of cardiovascular disease or stroke were included in the study. The baseline study included a physical examination, fasting laboratory tests, and 24-h ambulatory ECG monitoring. We selected the time-domain components of heart-rate variability for further analyses. C-reactive protein concentration and white blood cell count were selected as markers of inflammation. After identifying parameters related to measures of heart-rate variability, we used regression analyses to evaluate independent associations. Heart-rate variability, as measured by the standard deviation of the time between normal-to-normal complexes or the standard deviation of the average of normal-to-normal intervals for each 5-min period, was negatively associated with smoking, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, blood sugar and triglyceride concentration, female gender, and diabetes. In contrast, physical activity was strongly associated with higher heart-rate variability. In multivariate regression analyses, increased heart-rate and reduced heart-rate variability were significantly and independently related to white blood cell count or C-reactive protein concentration.

CONCLUSION: Increased heart rate and reduced heart-rate variability are associated with subclinical inflammation in healthy middle-aged and elderly subjects. The increased mortality that has been reported in these settings may thus have a common aetiology. An autonomic imbalance in favour of the sympathetic system may interact with inflammatory processes to play a more important role in the process of atherosclerosis than previously thought.},

title = {Pulmonary function is a long-term predictor of mortality in the general population: 29-year follow-up of the Buffalo Health Study},
abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Results from several studies have described a relationship between pulmonary function and both all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive value of pulmonary function by gender after 29 years of follow-up.

DESIGN: Prospective study with 29-year follow-up of the Buffalo Health Study cohort.

PARTICIPANTS: Randomly selected sample of 554 men and 641 women, aged 20 to 89 years, from all listed households of the city of Buffalo, NY.

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Baseline measurements were performed in 1960 to 1961. Pulmonary function was assessed based on FEV(1) expressed as the normal percent predicted (FEV(1)%pred). FEV(1)%pred adjusted by age, body mass index, systolic BP, education, and smoking status was inversely related to all-cause mortality in both men and women (p<0.01). A sequential survival analysis in participants who had a survival time of at least 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years after enrollment in the study was also performed. Except for men who survived for > 25 years, we observed a statistically significant negative association between FEV(1)%pred and all-cause mortality. FEV(1)%pred was also inversely related to ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality. When participants were divided into quintiles of FEV(1)%pred, participants in the lowest quintile of FEV(1)%pred experienced significantly higher all-cause mortality compared with participants in the highest quintile of FEV(1)%pred. For the entire follow-up period, the adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 3.13) for men and 1. 81 (95% CI, 1.24 to 2.63) for women, respectively. Hazard ratios for death from IHD in the lowest quintile of FEV(1)%pred were 2.11 (95% CI, 1.20 to 3.71) and 1.96 (95% CI, 0.99 to 3.88) for men and women, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pulmonary function is a long-term predictor for overall survival rates in both genders and could be used as a tool in general health assessment.},

		  of outdoor air pollution on respiratory morbidity in
		  children after controlling for the confounding effects of
		  weather, season, and other pollutants. METHODS: The study
		  used data on respiratory hospital admissions in children
		  (three age groups: < 1, 1-4, and 5-14 years) for five
		  cities in Australia and two in New Zealand. Time series of
		  daily numbers of hospital admissions were analyzed using
		  the case-crossover method; the results from cities were
		  combined using a random-effects meta-analysis. MEASUREMENTS
		  AND MAIN RESULTS: Significant increases across the cities
		  were observed for hospital admissions in children for
		  pneumonia and acute bronchitis (0, 1-4 years), respiratory
		  disease (0, 1-4, 5-14 years), and asthma (5-14 years).
		  These increases were found for particulate matter with a
		  diameter less than 2.5 microm (PM2.5) and less than 10
		  microm (PM10), nephelometry, NO2, and SO2. The largest
		  association found was a 6.0\% increase in asthma admissions
		  (5-14 years) in relation to a 5.1-ppb increase in 24-hour
		  NO2. CONCLUSIONS: This study found strong and consistent
		  associations between outdoor air pollution and short-term
		  increases in childhood hospital admissions. A number of
		  different pollutants showed significant associations, and
		  these were distinct from any temperature (warm or cool)
		  effects.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to estimate the
		  associations between outdoor air pollution and
		  cardiovascular hospital admissions for the elderly. DESIGN:
		  Associations were assessed using the case-crossover method
		  for seven cities: Auckland and Christchurch, New Zealand;
		  and Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney
		  Australia. Results were combined across cities using a
		  random-effects meta-analysis and stratified for two adult
		  age groups: 15-64 years and >/= 65 years of age (elderly).
		  Pollutants considered were nitrogen dioxide, carbon
		  monoxide, daily measures of particulate matter (PM) and
		  ozone. Where multiple pollutant associations were found, a
		  matched case-control analysis was used to identify the most
		  consistent association. RESULTS: In the elderly, all
		  pollutants except O3 were significantly associated with
		  five categories of cardiovascular disease admissions. No
		  associations were found for arrhythmia and stroke. For a
		  0.9-ppm increase in CO, there were significant increases in
		  elderly hospital admissions for total cardiovascular
		  disease (2.2\%) , all cardiac disease (2.8\%), cardiac
		  failure (6.0\%), ischemic heart disease (2.3\%), and
		  myocardial infarction (2.9\%). There was some heterogeneity
		  between cities, possibly due to differences in humidity and
		  the percentage of elderly people. In matched analyses, CO
		  had the most consistent association. CONCLUSIONS: The
		  results suggest that air pollution arising from common
		  emission sources for CO, NO2, and PM (e.g., motor vehicle
		  exhausts) has significant associations with adult
		  cardiovascular hospital admissions, especially in the
		  elderly, at air pollution concentrations below normal
		  health guidelines. Relevance to clinical and professional
		  practice: Elderly populations in Australia need to be
		  protected from air pollution arising from outdoor sources
		  to reduce cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Time-series analyses have been used for
		  decades to investigate time-varying environmental
		  exposures. Recently, the case-crossover design has been
		  applied to assess acute effects of air pollution. Our
		  objective was to compare time-series and case-crossover
		  analyses using varying referent periods (ie,
		  unidirectional, ambidirectional, and time-stratified).
		  METHODS: We examined the association between temperature
		  and cardiorespiratory mortality among the elderly
		  population in the 20 largest metropolitan areas of the
		  United States. Risks were estimated by season and
		  geographic region in 1992. We obtained weather data from
		  the National Climatic Data Center and mortality data from
		  the Division of Vital Statistics. Conditional logistic
		  regression (case-crossover) and Poisson regression
		  (time-series) were used to estimate the increased risk of
		  cardiorespiratory mortality associated with a 10 degrees F
		  increase in daily temperature, accounting for dew-point
		  temperature and other potential confounding factors.
		  RESULTS: In the time-stratified case-crossover analysis,
		  the strongest associations were found in the summer; in the
		  Southwest, Southeast, Northwest, Northeast, and Midwest,
		  the odds ratios were 1.15 (95\% confidence
		  interval=1.07-1.24), 1.10 (0.96-1.27), 1.08 (0.92-1.26),
		  1.08 (1.02-1.15), and 1.01 (0.92-1.11), respectively.
		  Mostly null or negative associations were found in the
		  winter, spring, and fall. The ambidirectional
		  case-crossover and the time-series analyses produced
		  quantitatively similar results to those from the
		  time-stratified analysis. The unidirectional analysis
		  produced conflicting results. CONCLUSIONS: Inferences from
		  studies of weather and mortality using the ambidirectional
		  or time-stratified case-crossover approaches and the
		  time-series analyses are comparable and provide consistent
		  findings in this study.},

  abstract	= {The case-crossover study design is a popular analytic tool
		  for estimating the effects of triggers of acute outcomes by
		  environmental exposures. Although this approach controls
		  for time-invariant confounders by design, it may allow for
		  selection bias and confounding by time-varying factors. We
		  conducted a simulation study of the sensitivity of the
		  symmetric bidirectional case-crossover design to
		  time-varying patterns in exposure and outcome. We
		  identified the effects of selection bias and confounding on
		  symmetric bidirectional case-crossover results and offer
		  strategies to eliminate or reduce these biases. Selection
		  bias results when exposure in the reference periods is not
		  identically representative of exposure in the hazard
		  periods, even when the distribution of exposure is
		  stationary. This bias can be estimated and removed.
		  Selection bias also occurs when the distribution of
		  exposure is nonstationary, but the adjusted symmetric
		  bidirectional case-crossover methodology substantially

		  particulate matter have begun to be characterized, but the
		  independent contributions of specific factors have not been
		  explored. METHODS: We used a case-crossover study to
		  examine PM10-associated mortality risk during 1988-1991
		  among 65,180 elderly residents of Cook County, Illinois,
		  who had a history of hospitalization for heart or lung
		  disease. We assessed how the effect was independently
		  modified by specific diagnoses and personal
		  characteristics. RESULTS: We found a 1.14\% (95\%
		  confidence interval [CI] = 0.44\% to 1.85\%) increased risk
		  of death per 10 microg/m3 increase in ambient PM10
		  concentration. Persons with heart or lung disease-but no
		  specific diagnosis of myocardial infarction, diabetes,
		  congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary
		  disorder, or conduction disorders-were at 0.74\% (-0.29\%
		  to 1.79\%) increased risk. Persons with a history of
		  myocardial infarction had a 2.7-fold higher risk (CI = -2.1
		  to 7.4). Those with diabetes carried a 2.0-fold higher risk
		  (CI = -1.5 to 5.5). Risk appeared to decrease with age
		  among elderly men and increase with age among elderly
		  women, but the estimated 3-way interaction was not precise
		  enough to exclude the null. We found no indication that
		  susceptibility varied by group-level socioeconomic
		  measures. CONCLUSION: Among a frail population, individuals
		  diagnosed with myocardial infarction or diabetes were at
		  greatest risk of death associated with high concentrations
		  of PM10. These results suggest that their susceptibility
		  may derive from prior vascular damage to the heart.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Although many time-series studies of ozone and
		  mortality have identified positive associations, others
		  have yielded null or inconclusive results, making the
		  results of these studies difficult to interpret. METHODS:
		  We performed a meta-analysis of 144 effect estimates from
		  39 time-series studies, and estimated pooled effects by
		  lags, age groups, cause-specific mortality, and
		  concentration metrics. We compared results with pooled
		  estimates from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air
		  Pollution Study (NMMAPS), a time-series study of 95 large
		  U.S. urban centers from 1987 to 2000. RESULTS: Both
		  meta-analysis and NMMAPS results provided strong evidence
		  of a short-term association between ozone and mortality,
		  with larger effects for cardiovascular and respiratory
		  mortality, the elderly, and current-day ozone exposure. In
		  both analyses, results were insensitive to adjustment for
		  particulate matter and model specifications. In the
		  meta-analysis, a 10-ppb increase in daily ozone at
		  single-day or 2-day average of lags 0, 1, or 2 days was
		  associated with an 0.87\% increase in total mortality (95\%
		  posterior interval = 0.55\% to 1.18\%), whereas the lag 0
		  NMMAPS estimate is 0.25\% (0.12\% to 0.39\%). Several
		  findings indicate possible publication bias: meta-analysis
		  results were consistently larger than those from NMMAPS;
		  meta-analysis pooled estimates at lags 0 or 1 were larger
		  when only a single lag was reported than when estimates for
		  multiple lags were reported; and heterogeneity of
		  city-specific estimates in the meta-analysis were larger
		  than with NMMAPS. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence
		  of short-term associations between ozone and mortality as
		  well as evidence of publication bias.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Although numerous studies have demonstrated
		  links between particulate matter (PM) and adverse health
		  effects, the chemical components of the PM mixture that
		  cause injury are unknown. OBJECTIVES: This work
		  characterizes spatial and temporal variability of PM(2.5)
		  (PM with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 microm) components in
		  the United States; our objective is to identify components
		  for assessment in epidemiologic studies. METHODS: We
		  constructed a database of 52 PM(2.5) component
		  concentrations for 187 U.S. counties for 2000-2005. First,
		  we describe the challenges inherent to analysis of a
		  national PM(2.5) chemical composition database. Second, we
		  identify components that contribute substantially to and/or
		  co-vary with PM(2.5) total mass. Third, we characterize the
		  seasonal and regional variability of targeted components.
		  RESULTS: Strong seasonal and geographic variations in
		  PM(2.5) chemical composition are identified. Only seven of
		  the 52 components contributed >/= 1\% to total mass for
		  yearly or seasonal averages [ammonium (NH(4) (+)),
		  elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon matter (OCM), nitrate
		  (NO(3) (-)), silicon, sodium (Na(+)), and sulfate (SO(4)
		  (2-))]. Strongest correlations with PM(2.5) total mass were
		  with NH(4) (+) (yearly), OCM (especially winter), NO(3) (-)
		  (winter), and SO(4) (2-) (yearly, spring, autumn, and
		  summer), with particularly strong correlations for NH(4)
		  (+) and SO(4) (2-) in summer. Components that co-varied
		  with PM(2.5) total mass, based on daily detrended data,
		  were NH(4) (+), SO(4) (2-) (,) OCM, NO(3) (2-), bromine,
		  and EC. CONCLUSIONS: The subset of identified PM(2.5)
		  components should be investigated further to determine
		  whether their daily variation is associated with daily
		  variation of health indicators, and whether their seasonal
		  and regional patterns can explain the seasonal and regional
		  heterogeneity in PM(10) (PM with aerodynamic diameter < 10
		  microm) and PM(2.5) health risks.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Evidence on risk of cardiovascular disease
		  (CVD) hospitalization associated with short-term exposure
		  to outdoor carbon monoxide (CO), an air pollutant primarily
		  generated by traffic, is inconsistent across studies.
		  Uncertainties remain on the degree to which associations
		  are attributable to other traffic pollutants and whether
		  effects persist at low levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
		  conducted a multisite time-series study to estimate risk of
		  CVD hospitalization associated with short-term CO exposure
		  in 126 US urban counties during 1999-2005 for >9.3 million
		  Medicare enrollees aged > or =65 years. We considered
		  models with adjustment by other traffic-related pollutants:
		  NO2, fine particulate matter (with aerodynamic diameter <
		  or =2.5 microm), and elemental carbon. We found a positive
		  and statistically significant association between same-day
		  CO and increased risk of hospitalization for multiple CVD
		  outcomes (ischemic heart disease, heart rhythm
		  disturbances, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, total
		  CVD). The association remained positive and statistically
		  significant but was attenuated with copollutant adjustment,
		  especially NO2. A 1-ppm increase in same-day daily 1-hour
		  maximum CO was associated with a 0.96% (95% posterior
		  interval, 0.79%, 1.12%) increase in risk of CVD admissions.
		  With same-day NO(2) adjustment, this estimate was 0.55%
		  (0.36%, 0.74%). The risk persisted at low CO levels <1 ppm.
		  CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of an association between
		  short-term exposure to ambient CO and risk of CVD
		  hospitalizations, even at levels well below current US
		  health-based regulatory standards. This evidence indicates
		  that exposure to current CO levels may still pose a public
		  health threat, particularly for persons with CVD.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The 'case-crossover' design is a strategy
		  fitted to studying transient effects of intermittent
		  exposure on acute-onset disease occurring shortly after
		  exposure. It has the important advantage of eliminating
		  most confounding variables, allowing a stronger causality
		  inference. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to
		  evaluate the relationships between emergency room (ER)
		  visits for asthma attacks and gaseous air pollution
		  changes. METHODS: The study included 549 individuals, 3-49
		  years old, visiting the ER during 1 year. Exposure to
		  gaseous air pollutants (SO2, NO2, O3) on the same day and
		  up to 4 days before was computed according to the patient's
		  address. The statistical analysis included meteorological
		  data as potential confounding variables. RESULTS: No
		  association could be shown between ER visits and SO2 or NO2
		  levels. In contrast, there was a statistically significant
		  association between ER visits and mean O3 levels, on the
		  day of admission and also on D -2 and D -3. For an increase
		  of 10 microg/m3, the risk of requiring an ER admission
		  increased by 6-10\%. CONCLUSIONS: Using this new strategy,
		  we confirmed that ozone changes lead to a moderate increase
		  in risk of requiring an ER admission in asthmatic
		  subjects.},

  abstract	= {Cohort study designs are often used to assess the
		  association between community-based ambient air pollution
		  concentrations and health outcomes, such as mortality,
		  development and prevalence of disease, and pulmonary
		  function. Typically, a large number of subjects are
		  enrolled in the study in each of a small number of
		  communities. Fixed-site monitors are used to determine
		  long-term exposure to ambient pollution. The association
		  between community average pollution levels and health is
		  determined after controlling for risk factors of the health
		  outcome measured at the individual level (i.e., smoking).
		  We present a new spatial regression model linking spatial
		  variation in ambient air pollution to health. Health
		  outcomes can be measured as continuous variables (pulmonary
		  function), binary variables (prevalence of disease), or
		  time-to-event data (survival or development of disease).
		  The model incorporates risk factors measured at the
		  individual level, such as smoking, and at the community
		  level, such as air pollution. We demonstrate that the
		  spatial autocorrelation in community health outcomes, an
		  indication of not fully characterizing potentially
		  confounding risk factors to the air pollution--health
		  association, can be accounted for through the inclusion of
		  location in the deterministic component of the model
		  assessing the effects of air pollution on health or through
		  a distance-decay spatial autocorrelation function in the
		  stochastic component of the model, or both. We present a
		  statistical approach that can be implemented for very large
		  cohort studies. Our methods are illustrated with an
		  analysis of the American Cancer Society cohort to determine
		  whether the prevalence of heart disease is associated with
		  concentrations of sulfate particles. From a statistical
		  point of view, it appears that a location surface in the
		  deterministic component of the model was preferred to a
		  distance-decay autocorrelation structure in the model's
		  stochastic component.},

  abstract	= {Numerous recent epidemiologic studies report increases in
		  the daily incidence of cardiovascular disease mortality and
		  morbidity related to increases in daily levels of fine
		  particulate matter (PM)* air pollution. This study sought
		  to evaluate the possible association between the occurrence
		  of out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and daily PM
		  levels in the Seattle metropolitan area. The underlying
		  hypothesis was that PM exposure may act as a cardiovascular
		  trigger for SCA. A case-crossover study was conducted among
		  362 SCA cases identified by paramedics from October 1988
		  through June 1994. Cases were King County WA residents who
		  were married, aged 25 to 74 years at the time of their SCA,
		  with no prior history of clinically recognized heart
		  disease or other life-threatening comorbid conditions.
		  Daily averages of regional PM monitoring data for
		  nephelometry measures of PM (reported in units of bsp,
		  referred to as coefficient of light scattering) and PM10
		  (particulate matter 10 microm or smaller in aerodynamic
		  diameter) from three monitoring sites were used as
		  indicators of exposure. In the case-crossover analysis, PM
		  levels during index times of cases within the five days
		  preceding an SCA were compared with PM levels at referent
		  days, defined as the same days of the week during the month
		  of SCA occurrence. Lag periods for index days of 0 to 5
		  days were investigated. The estimated relative risk (RR) at
		  a lag of 1 day for an interquartile range (IQR) change in
		  nephelometry (0.51 bsp) was 0.893 (95\% confidence interval
		  [CI] 0.779-1.024). Varying the lag period had only minimal
		  change on the observed association. The estimated relative
		  risk at a lag of 1 day for an IQR change of PM10 (19.3
		  microg/m3) was 0.868 (95\% CI 0.744-1.012). There was no
		  evidence of confounding by ambient daily exposures to
		  carbon monoxide or sulfur dioxide. Analysis of effect
		  modification by individual-level variables, including age,
		  cigarette smoke exposure, physical activity, and other risk

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Daily air pollution is associated with
		  increased hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases,
		  but there are few observations on the link with acute
		  myocardial infarction. To evaluate the relation between
		  various urban air pollutants (total suspended particulate,
		  SO2, CO, NO2) and hospital admissions for acute myocardial
		  infarction in Rome, Italy, we performed a case-crossover
		  analysis and studied whether individual characteristics act
		  as effect modifiers. METHODS: We studied 6531 subjects
		  residing in Rome and hospitalized for a first episode of
		  acute myocardial infarction (International Classification
		  of Diseases, 9th edition: 410) from January 1995 to June
		  1997. The following individual information was available:
		  sex, age, date of hospitalization, coexisting illnesses
		  (hypertension, 25\%; diabetes, 15\%), and cardiac severity
		  (conduction disorders, 6\%; cardiac dysrhythmias, 20\%;
		  heart failure, 11\%). Daily air pollution data were taken
		  from 5 city monitors. We used a time-stratified
		  case-crossover design; control days were the same day of
		  the week as the myocardial infarction occurred, in other
		  weeks of the month. RESULTS: Positive associations were
		  found for total suspended particulate, NO2 and CO. The
		  strongest and most consistent effect was found for total
		  suspended particulate. The odds ratio (OR) associated with
		  10 micro g/m3 of total suspended particulate over the 0- to
		  2-day lag was 1.028 (95\% confidence interval [CI] =
		  1.005-1.052). The association with total suspended
		  particulate tended to be stronger among people older than
		  74 years of age (OR = 1.046; CI = 1.005-1.089), in the warm
		  period of the year (OR = 1.046; CI = 1.008-1.087), and
		  among subjects who had heart conduction disorders (OR =
		  1.080; CI = 0.987-1.181). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest
		  that air pollution increases the risk of myocardial
		  infarction, especially during the warm season. There was a
		  tendency for a stronger effect among the elderly and people
		  with heart conduction disturbances.},

		  is a flexible and effective technique for conducting
		  nonlinear regression analysis in time-series studies of the
		  health effects of air pollution. When the data to which the
		  GAM are being applied have two characteristics--1) the
		  estimated regression coefficients are small and 2) there
		  exist confounding factors that are modeled using at least
		  two nonparametric smooth functions--the default settings in
		  the gam function of the S-Plus software package (version
		  3.4) do not assure convergence of its iterative estimation
		  procedure and can provide biased estimates of regression
		  coefficients and standard errors. This phenomenon has
		  occurred in time-series analyses of contemporary data on
		  air pollution and mortality. To evaluate the impact of
		  default implementation of the gam software on published
		  analyses, the authors reanalyzed data from the National
		  Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS)
		  using three different methods: 1) Poisson regression with
		  parametric nonlinear adjustments for confounding factors;
		  2) GAM with default convergence parameters; and 3) GAM with
		  more stringent convergence parameters than the default
		  settings. The authors found that pooled NMMAPS estimates

  abstract	= {In this paper, we present national maps of relative rates
		  of mortality associated with short-term exposure to

		  (PM(10)). We report results for 88 of the largest
		  metropolitan areas in the United States from 1987 to 1994
		  for all-cause mortality, combined cardiovascular and
		  respiratory deaths, and other causes of mortality. Maximum
		  likelihood estimates of the relative rate of mortality
		  associated with PM(10)and the degree of statistical
		  uncertainty were obtained for each of the 88 cities by
		  fitting a separate log-linear regression of the daily
		  mortality rate on air pollution level and potential
		  confounders. We obtained Bayesian estimates of the relative
		  rates by fitting a hierarchical model that takes into
		  account spatial correlation among the true city-specific
		  relative rates. We found that daily variations of PM(10)
		  are positively associated with daily variations of
		  mortality. In particular, the relative rate estimates of
		  cardiovascular and respiratory mortality associated with
		  PM(10) are larger on average than the relative rate
		  estimates of all-cause and other-cause mortality. The
		  estimated increase in the relative rate of death from
		  cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, all-cause
		  mortality, and other-cause mortality were 0.31\% (95\%
		  posterior interval, 0.15-0.5), 0.22\% (95\% posterior
		  interval, 0.1-0.38), and 0.13\% (95\% posterior interval,
		  -0.05 to 0.29), respectively. Bayesian estimates of the
		  city-specific relative rates ranged from 0.23\% to 0.35\%
		  for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, from 0.18\%
		  to 0.27\% for all causes, and from 0.10\% to 0.20\% for
		  other causes of mortality. The spatial characterization of
		  effects across cities offers the potential to identify
		  factors that could influence the effect of PM(10) on
		  health, including particle characteristics, offering
		  insights into mechanisms by which PM(10) causes adverse
		  health effects.},

  abstract	= {One barrier to interpreting the observational evidence
		  concerning the adverse health effects of air pollution for
		  public policy purposes is the measurement error inherent in
		  estimates of exposure based on ambient pollutant monitors.
		  Exposure assessment studies have shown that data from
		  monitors at central sites may not adequately represent
		  personal exposure. Thus, the exposure error resulting from
		  using centrally measured data as a surrogate for personal
		  exposure can potentially lead to a bias in estimates of the
		  health effects of air pollution. This paper develops a
		  multi-stage Poisson regression model for evaluating the
		  effects of exposure measurement error on estimates of
		  effects of particulate air pollution on mortality in
		  time-series studies. To implement the model, we have used
		  five validation data sets on personal exposure to PM10. Our
		  goal is to combine data on the associations between ambient
		  concentrations of particulate matter and mortality for a
		  specific location, with the validation data on the
		  association between ambient and personal concentrations of
		  particulate matter at the locations where data have been
		  collected. We use these data in a model to estimate the
		  relative risk of mortality associated with estimated
		  personal-exposure concentrations and make a comparison with
		  the risk of mortality estimated with measurements of
		  ambient concentration alone. We apply this method to data
		  comprising daily mortality counts, ambient concentrations
		  of PM10measured at a central site, and temperature for
		  Baltimore, Maryland from 1987 to 1994. We have selected our
		  home city of Baltimore to illustrate the method; the
		  measurement error correction model is general and can be
		  applied to other appropriate locations.Our approach uses a
		  combination of: (1) a generalized additive model with log
		  link and Poisson error for the mortality-personal-exposure
		  association; (2) a multi-stage linear model to estimate the
		  variability across the five validation data sets in the
		  personal-ambient-exposure association; (3) data
		  augmentation methods to address the uncertainty resulting
		  from the missing personal exposure time series in
		  Baltimore. In the Poisson regression model, we account for
		  smooth seasonal and annual trends in mortality using
		  smoothing splines. Taking into account the heterogeneity
		  across locations in the personal-ambient-exposure
		  relationship, we quantify the degree to which the exposure
		  measurement error biases the results toward the null
		  hypothesis of no effect, and estimate the loss of precision
		  in the estimated health effects due to indirectly
		  estimating personal exposures from ambient measurements.},

		  paper, the authors estimate the association between air
		  pollution and mortality using different timescales of
		  variation in the air pollution time series to gain further
		  insight into this question. The authors' method is based on
		  a Fourier decomposition of air pollution time series into a
		  set of independent exposure variables, each representing a
		  different timescale. The authors then use this set of
		  variables as predictors in a Poisson regression model to
		  estimate a separate relative rate of mortality for each
		  exposure timescale. The method is applied to a database
		  containing information on daily mortality, particulate air
		  pollution, and weather in four US cities (Pittsburgh,
		  Pennsylvania; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Seattle, Washington;
		  and Chicago, Illinois) from the period 1987-1994. The
		  authors found larger relative rates of mortality associated
		  with particulate air pollution at longer timescale
		  variations (14 days-2 months) than at shorter timescales
		  (1-4 days). These analyses provide additional evidence that
		  associations between particle indexes and mortality do not
		  imply only an advance in the timing of death by a few days

  abstract	= {In this paper we develop a hierarchical bivariate time
		  series model to characterize the relationship between
		  particulate matter less than 10 microns in aerodynamic
		  diameter (PM10) and both mortality and hospital admissions
		  for cardiovascular diseases. The model is applied to time
		  series data on mortality and morbidity for 10 metropolitan
		  areas in the United States from 1986 to 1993. We postulate
		  that these time series should be related through a shared
		  relationship with PM10. At the first stage of the
		  hierarchy, we fit two seemingly unrelated Poisson
		  regression models to produce city-specific estimates of the
		  log relative rates of mortality and morbidity associated
		  with exposure to PM10 within each location. The sample
		  covariance matrix of the estimated log relative rates is
		  obtained using a novel generalized estimating equation
		  approach that takes into account the correlation between
		  the mortality and morbidity time series. At the second
		  stage, we combine information across locations to estimate
		  overall log relative rates of mortality and morbidity and
		  variation of the rates across cities. Using the combined
		  information across the 10 locations we find that a 10
		  microg/m3 increase in average PM10 at the current day and
		  previous day is associated with a 0.26\% increase in
		  mortality (95\% posterior interval -0.37, 0.65), and a
		  0.71\% increase in hospital admissions (95\% posterior
		  interval 0.35, 0.99). The log relative rates of mortality
		  and morbidity have a similar degree of heterogeneity across
		  cities: the posterior means of the between-city standard
		  deviations of the mortality and morbidity air pollution
		  effects are 0.42 (95\% interval 0.05, 1.18), and 0.31 (95\%
		  interval 0.10, 0.89), respectively. The city-specific log
		  relative rates of mortality and morbidity are estimated to
		  have very low correlation, but the uncertainty in the
		  correlation is very substantial (posterior mean = 0.20,
		  95\% interval -0.89, 0.98). With the parameter estimates
		  from the model, we can predict the hospitalization log
		  relative rate for a new city for which hospitalization data
		  are unavailable, using that city's estimated mortality
		  relative rate. We illustrate this prediction using New York
		  as an example.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Application of case-crossover designs provides
		  an alternative to time-series analysis for analyzing the
		  health-related effects of air pollution. Although some
		  case-crossover studies can control for trend and
		  seasonality by design, to date they have been analyzed as
		  matched case-control studies. Such analyses may exhibit
		  biases and a lower statistical efficiency than traditional
		  time series analyzed with Poisson. METHODS: In this
		  article, case-crossover studies are treated as cohort
		  studies in which each subject is observed for a short
		  period of time before and/or after the event, thus making
		  possible analyzing with Andersen-Gill and generalized
		  linear mixed models. We conducted a simulation study to
		  compare the behavior of these models applied to
		  case-crossover designs with time series analyzed with
		  Poisson and with case-crossover analyzed by conditional
		  logistic regression. To this end, we created a random
		  variable that follows a Poisson distribution of low (2/day)
		  and high mean events (22/day). This variable is a function
		  of an unobserved confounding variable (that introduces
		  trend and seasonality) and data on small particulate matter
		  (PM10) from Barcelona. In addition, scenarios were created
		  to assess the effect on exposure exerted by autocorrelation
		  and the magnitude of the pollutant coefficient. RESULTS:
		  The full semisymmetric design analyzed with generalized
		  linear mixed models yields good coverage and a high
		  statistical power for air-pollution effect magnitudes close
		  to the real values but shows bias for high effect
		  magnitudes. This bias seems to be attributable to
		  autocorrelation in the exposure variable. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Longitudinal approaches applied to case-crossover designs
		  may prove useful for analyzing the acute effects of
		  environmental exposures.},

		  identification of susceptible subgroups in the population.
		  We studied individual characteristics that modify the
		  relationship between particulate air pollution and
		  mortality among elderly. METHOD: We examined 527
		  nonaccidental deaths (197 cardiorespiratory deaths) among
		  the 1469 subjects from the Personnes Agees QUID cohort in
		  Bordeaux between 1988 and 1997. Air pollution was measured
		  as black smoke by urban monitoring background stations. We
		  used a case crossover approach and calculated odds ratio by
		  conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: We
		  observed associations between the third lag day and
		  cardiorespiratory mortality for an increase of 10 microg/m3
		  of black smoke (odds ratio = 1.30, 95\% confidence
		  interval: 1.01-1.68). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide
		  insight into factors possibly conferring susceptibility to
		  the acute effect of urban air pollution.},

  abstract	= {RATIONALE: Out-of-hospital coronary heart disease death is
		  a major public health problem, but the association with air
		  pollution is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated
		  the association between daily ambient air pollution levels
		  (particle number concentration [PNC]--a proxy for ultrafine
		  particles [diameter < 0.1 microm], mass of particles with
		  diameter less than 10 microm [PM10]; CO, NO2, and O3) and
		  the occurrence of fatal, nonhospitalized coronary events.
		  METHODS: Subjects were 5,144 out-of-hospital fatalities
		  (410-414, International Classification of Diseases-9;
		  1998-2000) who had been residents of Rome. Hospitalizations
		  during the 3 yr before death were considered to identify
		  comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, heart failure,
		  dysrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
		  Statistical analyses were performed using a case-crossover
		  design. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The association with
		  out-of-hospital coronary deaths was statistically
		  significant for PNC, PM10, and CO. Air pollution on the day
		  of death had the strongest effect (e.g., 7.6\% increase
		  [95\% confidence interval, 2.0-13.6\%]) for an
		  interquartile range of PNC, 27,790 particles/cm3. The
		  65-74- and 75+-yr age groups were at higher risk than the
		  35-64-yr age group, and there was a suggestion of effect
		  modification for people with hypertension and chronic
		  obstructive pulmonary disease. CONCLUSIONS: Air pollutants
		  originating from combustion processes, including ultrafine
		  particles, are related to fatal, nonhospitalized coronary
		  events. The effect is stronger among people over 65 years
		  of age, but is not limited to a group with a specific
		  comorbidity.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Short-term increases in particulate air
		  pollution are linked with increased daily mortality and
		  morbidity. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a determinant of
		  overall health. We investigated whether social class is an
		  effect modifier of the PM(10) (particulate matter with
		  diameter <10 micron)-daily mortality association, and
		  possible mechanisms for this effect modification. METHODS:
		  Area-based traffic emissions, income, and SES were
		  available for each resident in Rome. All natural deaths
		  (83,253 subjects) occurring in Rome among city residents
		  (aged 35+ years) during the period 1998-2001 were
		  identified. For each deceased individual, all the previous
		  hospitalizations within 2 years before death were available
		  via a record linkage procedure. PM(10) daily data were
		  available from two urban monitoring sites. A case-crossover
		  analysis was utilized in which control days were selected
		  according to the time stratified approach (same day of the
		  week during the same month). Conditional logistic
		  regression was used. RESULTS: Due to the social class
		  distribution in the city, exposure to traffic emissions was
		  higher among those with higher area-based income and SES.
		  Meanwhile, people of lower social class had suffered to a
		  larger extent from chronic diseases before death than more
		  affluent residents, especially diabetes mellitus,
		  hypertension, heart failure, and chronic obstructive
		  pulmonary diseases. Overall, PM(10) (lag 0-1) was strongly
		  associated with mortality (1.1\% increase, 95\%CI =
		  0.7-1.6\%, per 10 microg/m(3)). The effect was more
		  pronounced among persons with lower income and SES (1.9\%
		  and 1.4\% per 10 microg/m(3), respectively) compared to
		  those in the upper income and SES levels (0.0\% and 0.1\%,
		  respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm previous
		  suggestions of a stronger effect of particulate air
		  pollution among people in low social class. Given the
		  uneven geographical distributions of social deprivation and
		  traffic emissions in Rome, the most likely explanation is a
		  differential burden of chronic health conditions conferring
		  a greater susceptibility to less advantaged people.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Time series analysis is the most commonly used
		  technique for assessing the association between counts of
		  health events over time and exposure to ambient air
		  pollution. Recently, case-crossover analysis has been
		  proposed as an alternative analytical approach. While each
		  technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, there
		  remains considerable uncertainty as to which statistical
		  methodology is preferable for evaluating data of this type.
		  METHODS: The objective of this paper is to evaluate the
		  performance of different variations of these two procedures
		  using computer simulation. Hospital admission data were
		  generated under realistic models with known parameters
		  permitting estimates based on time series and
		  case-crossover analyses to be compared with these known
		  values. RESULTS: While accurate estimates can be achieved
		  with both methods, both methods require some decisions to
		  be made by the researcher during the course of the
		  analysis. With time series analysis, it is necessary to
		  choose the time span in the LOESS smoothing process, or
		  degrees of freedom when using natural cubic splines. For
		  case-crossover studies using either uni- or bi-directional
		  control selection strategies, the choice of time intervals
		  needs to be made. CONCLUSIONS: We prefer the times series
		  approach because the best estimates of risk that can be
		  obtained with time series analysis are more precise than
		  the best estimates based on case-crossover analysis.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The effect of indoor nitrogen dioxide
		  concentrations on asthma morbidity among inner-city
		  preschool children is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was
		  to estimate the effect of indoor NO2 concentrations on
		  asthma morbidity in an inner-city population while
		  adjusting for other indoor pollutants. METHODS: We
		  recruited 150 children (2-6 years of age) with
		  physician-diagnosed asthma from inner-city Baltimore,
		  Maryland. Indoor air was monitored over a 72-hr period in
		  the children's bedrooms at baseline and 3 and 6 months. At
		  each visit, the child's caregiver completed a questionnaire
		  assessing asthma symptoms over the previous 2 weeks and
		  recent health care utilization. RESULTS: Children were 58%
		  male, 91% African American, and 42% from households with
		  annual income < {\$}25,000; 63% had persistent asthma
		  symptoms. The mean (+/- SD) in-home NO2 concentration was
		  30.0 +/- 33.7 (range, 2.9-394.0) ppb. The presence of a gas
		  stove and the use of a space heater or oven/stove for heat
		  were independently associated with higher NO2
		  concentrations. Each 20-ppb increase in NO2 exposure was
		  associated significantly with an increase in the number of
		  days with limited speech [incidence rate ratio (IRR) =
		  1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.25], cough (IRR
		  = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18), and nocturnal symptoms (IRR =
		  1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.16), after adjustment for potential
		  confounders. NO2 concentrations were not associated with
		  increased health care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Higher
		  indoor NO2 concentrations were associated with increased
		  asthma symptoms in preschool inner-city children.
		  Interventions aimed at lowering NO2 concentrations in
		  inner-city homes may reduce asthma morbidity in this
		  vulnerable population.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between air
		  pollutants and the occurrence of acute stroke from 10-year
		  population-based study. METHODS: The daily stroke count was
		  obtained from Dijon Stroke Register between March 1994 and
		  December 2004. The register recorded all first-ever strokes
		  among residents of Dijon (150,000 inhabitants) in France,
		  using standard diagnostic criteria. Pollutant
		  concentrations (SO2, CO, NO2, O3 and PM10) were measured
		  hourly. A bi-directional case-crossover design was used to
		  examine the association between air pollutant and stroke
		  onset. The conditional logistic regression model included
		  the meteorological parameters (temperature, relative
		  humidity), influenza epidemics and holidays. RESULTS: The
		  authors collected 493 large artery infarcts, 397 small
		  artery infarcts, 530 cardio-embolic infarcts, 67
		  undeterminate infarcts, 371 transient ischaemic attacks and
		  220 haemorrhagic strokes. For single-pollutant model and
		  for a 10 mg/m(3) increase of O3 exposure, a positive
		  association was observed only in men, over 40 years of age,
		  between ischaemic stroke occurrence and O3 levels with
		  1-day lag, (OR 1.133, 95\% CI 1.052 to 1.220) and 0-day lag
		  (OR 1.058, 95\% CI 0.987 to 1.134). No significant
		  associations were found for haemorrhagic stroke. In
		  two-pollutant models, the effects of O3 remained
		  significant after each of the other pollutants were
		  included in the model, in particular with PM10. A
		  significant association was observed for ischaemic strokes
		  of large arteries (p = 0.02) and for transient ischaemic
		  attacks (p = 0.01). Moreover, the authors found an
		  exposure-response relations between O3 exposure and
		  ischaemic stroke (test for trend, p = 0.01). An increase in
		  association in men with several cardiovascular risk factors
		  (smoker, dyslipidemia and hypertension) was also observed.
		  CONCLUSION: These observational data argue for an
		  association between ischaemic stroke occurrence and O3
		  pollution levels; these results still need to be confirmed
		  by other studies.},

		  local ensemble transform Kalman filter},
  abstract	= {Data assimilation is an iterative approach to the problem
		  of estimating the state of a dynamical system using both
		  current and past observations of the system together with a
		  model for the system's time evolution. Rather than solving
		  the problem from scratch each time new observations become
		  available, one uses the model to "forecast" the current
		  state, using a prior state estimate (which incorporates
		  information from past data) as the initial condition, then
		  uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a
		  current state estimate. This Bayesian approach is most
		  effective when the uncertainty in both the observations and
		  in the state estimate, as it evolves over time, are
		  accurately quantified. In this article, we describe a
		  practical method for data assimilation in large,
		  spatiotemporally chaotic systems. The method is a type of
		  "ensemble Kalman filter", in which the state estimate and
		  its approximate uncertainty are represented at any given
		  time by an ensemble of system states. We discuss both the
		  mathematical basis of this approach and its implementation;
		  our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational
		  speed rather than improving accuracy over previously
		  published approaches to ensemble Kalman filtering. We
		  include some numerical results demonstrating the efficiency
		  and accuracy of our implementation for assimilating real
		  atmospheric data with the global forecast model used by the
		  US National Weather Service. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

  abstract	= {The case-crossover design was developed to study the
		  effects of transient, short-term exposures on the risk of
		  acute events, such as myocardial infarction, in the early
		  1990s. This paper illustrates how the principles of
		  case-crossover design are related to the principles of
		  crossover and case-control designs and stipulates the
		  possibilities of case-crossover design in air pollution
		  epidemiology. In the case-crossover design, the study
		  population consists of subjects who have experienced an
		  episode of the health outcome of interest. Similar to a
		  crossover study, each subject serves as his or her own
		  control. As in a matched case-control study, the inference
		  is based on a comparison of exposure distribution rather
		  than the risk of disease. The case-crossover study is most
		  suitable for studying relations with the following
		  characteristics: 1) the individual exposure varies within
		  short time intervals; 2) the disease has abrupt onset and
		  short latency for detection; and 3) the induction period is
		  short. Case-crossover design allows use of routinely
		  monitored air pollution information and at the same time
		  makes it possible to study individuals rather than days as
		  the unit of observation. Case-crossover design is amenable
		  for studying the effects of varying short-term air
		  pollution exposure on health outcomes with an abrupt onset,
		  such as myocardial infarction or asthma attack.},

  abstract	= {The case-crossover design has been widely used to study
		  the association between short-term air pollution exposure
		  and the risk of an acute adverse health event. The design
		  uses cases only; for each individual case, exposure just
		  before the event is compared with exposure at other control
		  (or "referent") times. Time-invariant confounders are
		  controlled by making within-subject comparisons. Even more
		  important in the air pollution setting is that time-varying
		  confounders can also be controlled by design by matching
		  referents to the index time. The referent selection
		  strategy is important for reasons in addition to control of
		  confounding. The case-crossover design makes the implicit
		  assumption that there is no trend in exposure across the
		  referent times. In addition, the statistical method that is
		  used-conditional logistic regression-is unbiased only with
		  certain referent strategies. We review here the
		  case-crossover literature in the air pollution context,
		  focusing on key issues regarding referent selection. We
		  conclude with a set of recommendations for choosing a
		  referent strategy with air pollution exposure data.
		  Specifically, we advocate the time-stratified approach to
		  referent selection because it ensures unbiased conditional
		  logistic regression estimates, avoids bias resulting from
		  time trend in the exposure series, and can be tailored to
		  match on specific time-varying confounders.},

		  event. It has commonly been used to study the effect of air
		  pollution on the risk of various adverse health events.
		  Proper selection of referents is crucial, especially with
		  air pollution exposures, which are shared, highly seasonal,
		  and often have a long-term time trend. Hence, careful
		  referent selection is important to control for time-varying
		  confounders, and in order to ensure that the distribution
		  of exposure is constant across referent times, a key
		  assumption of this method. Yet the referent strategy is
		  important for a more basic reason: the conditional logistic
		  regression estimating equations commonly used are biased
		  when referents are not chosen a priori and are functions of
		  the observed event times. We call this bias in the
		  estimating equations overlap bias. In this paper, we
		  propose a new taxonomy of referent selection strategies in
		  order to emphasize their statistical properties. We give a
		  derivation of overlap bias, explore its magnitude, and
		  consider how the bias depends on properties of the exposure
		  series. We conclude that the bias is usually small, though
		  highly unpredictable, and easily avoided.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The assessment of air pollution exposure using
		  only community average concentrations may lead to
		  measurement error that lowers estimates of the health
		  burden attributable to poor air quality. To test this
		  hypothesis, we modeled the association between air
		  pollution and mortality using small-area exposure measures
		  in Los Angeles, California. METHODS: Data on 22,905
		  subjects were extracted from the American Cancer Society
		  cohort for the period 1982-2000 (5,856 deaths). Pollution
		  exposures were interpolated from 23 fine particle (PM2.5)
		  and 42 ozone (O3) fixed-site monitors. Proximity to
		  expressways was tested as a measure of traffic pollution.
		  We assessed associations in standard and spatial multilevel
		  Cox regression models. RESULTS: After controlling for 44
		  individual covariates, all-cause mortality had a relative
		  risk (RR) of 1.17 (95\% confidence interval=1.05-1.30) for
		  an increase of 10 mug/m PM2.5 and a RR of 1.11 (0.99-1.25)
		  with maximal control for both individual and contextual
		  confounders. The RRs for mortality resulting from ischemic
		  heart disease and lung cancer deaths were elevated, in the
		  range of 1.24-1.6, depending on the model used. These PM
		  results were robust to adjustments for O3 and expressway
		  exposure. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the chronic
		  health effects associated with within-city gradients in
		  exposure to PM2.5 may be even larger than previously
		  reported across metropolitan areas. We observed effects
		  nearly 3 times greater than in models relying on
		  comparisons between communities. We also found specificity
		  in cause of death, with PM2.5 associated more strongly with
		  ischemic heart disease than with cardiopulmonary or
		  all-cause mortality.},

		  periods (unidirectional and bi-directional control

  abstract	= {We examined the association of infant bronchiolitis with
		  acute exposure to ambient air pollutants. DESIGN: We
		  employed a time-stratified case-crossover method and based
		  the exposure windows on a priori, biologically based
		  hypotheses. PARTICIPANTS: We evaluated effects in 19,901
		  infants in the South Coast Air Basin of California in
		  1995-2000 with a hospital discharge record for
		  bronchiolitis in the first year of life (International
		  Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, CM466.1).
		  EVALUATIONS/MEASUREMENTS: Study subjects' ZIP code was
		  linked to ambient air pollution monitors to derive
		  exposures. We estimated the risk of bronchiolitis
		  hospitalization associated with increases in wintertime
		  ambient air pollutants using conditional logistic
		  regression. RESULTS: We observed no increased risk after
		  acute exposure to particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in
		  aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, or nitrogen
		  dioxide. PM2.5 exposure models suggested a 26-41\%
		  increased risk in the most premature infants born at
		  gestational ages between 25 and 29 weeks; however, these
		  findings were based on very small numbers. CONCLUSIONS: We
		  found little support for a link between acute increases in
		  ambient air pollution and infant bronchiolitis except
		  modestly increased risk for PM2.5 exposure among infants
		  born very prematurely. In these infants, the periods of
		  viral acquisition and incubation concurred with the time of
		  increased risk. RELEVANCE TO PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE: We
		  present novel data for the infant period and the key
		  respiratory disease of infancy, bronchiolitis. Incompletely
		  explained trends in rising bronchiolitis hospitalization
		  rates and increasing number of infants born prematurely
		  underscore the importance of evaluating the impact of
		  ambient air pollution in this age group in other
		  populations and studies.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVES: Korean epidemiological studies have used
		  reduced samples according to the subject's characteristics,
		  such as the health services provided, the historical note
		  with asthma, and age, to examine the acute effect of air
		  pollution on asthma using the Korean National Health
		  Insurance records. However, there have been few studies on
		  whether the effects shown in these reduced samples are
		  different from those of all samples. This study compared
		  the effects of air pollution on asthma attacks in three
		  reduced samples with those of entire samples. METHODS: The
		  air pollution data for PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and O3 and
		  weather conditions including temperature, relative
		  humidity, and air pressure in Seoul, 2002, were obtained
		  from outdoor monitoring stations in Seoul. The emergency
		  hospital visits with an asthma attack in Seoul, 2002 were
		  extracted from the Korean National Health Insurance
		  records. From these, the reduced samples were created by
		  health service, historical notes with asthma, and age. A
		  case-crossover design was adopted and the acute effects of
		  air pollution on asthma were estimated after adjusting for
		  weather, time trend, and seasonality. The model was applied
		  to each reduced sample and the entire sample. RESULTS: With
		  respect to the health service, the effects on outpatients
		  were similar to those for the total sample but were
		  different for inpatients. These similar effect sizes were
		  also observed in the reduced samples according to the
		  historical note with asthma and age. The relative risks of
		  PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and O3 among the reduced and entire
		  samples were 1.03, 1.04-1.05, 1.02-1.03, 1.04-1.06, and
		  1.10-1.17, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was no clear

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVE: Some epidemiological literature has observed
		  that air pollution effects on health differed across
		  regional or individual socioeconomic position. This study
		  evaluated whether regional and individual socioeconomic
		  position, as indicated by health insurance premiums,
		  modified the effect of air pollution on hospital visits for
		  asthma. METHODS: Effects of ambient air pollutants
		  (particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide,
		  nitrogen dioxide, and ozone) on 92,535 emergency
		  out-patient hospital visits for asthma in Seoul, Korea
		  during 2002 were estimated using case-crossover analysis,
		  adjusting for time trend, weather conditions, and
		  seasonality. Next, interactions between air pollutants and
		  Korean National Health Insurance premium (1) for the
		  individual patient and (2) averaged across the patient's
		  residence district, were entered, first singly then
		  jointly, in the models. RESULTS: Relative risks of
		  emergency outpatient hospital visits were all positively
		  and significantly associated with interquartile increases
		  for selected lags for all air pollutants. In the regression
		  model with interaction terms for both individual premium
		  and regional-average premium, associations with all
		  five-air pollutants ranged from 1.03 to 1.09 times higher
		  among the lowest premium districts compared to the highest
		  premium districts. Of all the pollutants, nitrogen dioxide
		  showed the strongest associations in lower premium
		  districts compared to the higher premium districts.
		  Individual socioeconomic position did not modify the
		  associations in either the single or joint interaction
		  models. CONCLUSION: In Seoul, community but not individual
		  socioeconomic conditions modified risk of asthma hospital
		  visits on high air pollution days.},

		  of the Harvard Six Cities and the American Cancer Society
		  (ACS) studies of particulate air pollution and mortality.
		  The previous findings of the studies have been subject to
		  debate. In response, a reanalysis team, comprised of
		  Canadian and American researchers, was invited to
		  participate in an independent reanalysis project to address
		  the concerns. Phase I of the reanalysis involved the design
		  of data audits to determine whether each study conformed to
		  the consistency and accuracy of their data. Phase II of the
		  reanalysis involved conducting a series of comprehensive
		  analyses using alternative statistical methods. Alternative
		  models were also used to identify covariates that may
		  confound or modify the association of particulate air
		  pollution as well as identify sensitive population
		  subgroups. The audit demonstrated that the data in the
		  original analyses were of high quality, as were the risk
		  estimates reported by the original investigators. The
		  sensitivity analysis illustrated that the mortality risk
		  estimates reported in both studies were found to be robust
		  against alternative Cox models. Detailed investigation of
		  the covariate effects found a significant modifying effect
		  of education and a relative risk of mortality associated
		  with fine particles and declining education levels. The
		  study team applied spatial analytic methods to the ACS
		  data, resulting in various levels of spatial
		  autocorrelations supporting the reported association for
		  fine particles mortality of the original investigators as
		  well as demonstrating a significant association between
		  sulfur dioxide and mortality. Collectively, our reanalysis
		  suggest that mortality may be attributable to more than one
		  component of the complex mixture of ambient air pollutants
		  for U.S. urban areas.},

  abstract	= {Following the validation and replication of the Harvard
		  Six Cities Study (Krewski et al., this issue), we conducted
		  a wide range of sensitivity analyses to explore the
		  observed associations between long-term exposure to fine
		  particle or sulfate air pollution and mortality. We
		  examined the impact of alternative risk models on estimates
		  of risk, taking into account covariates not included in the
		  original analyses. These risk models provided a basis for
		  identifying covariates that may confound or modify the
		  association between fine particle or sulfate air pollution
		  and mortality, and for identifying sensitive population
		  subgroups. The possibility of confounding due to
		  occupational exposures was also investigated. Residence
		  histories were coded for the study subjects and were used
		  to examine temporal patterns of exposure and risk. Our
		  sensitivity analyses showed the mortality risk estimates
		  for fine particle and sulfate air pollution to be highly
		  robust against alternative risk models of the Cox
		  proportional hazards family, including models with
		  additional covariates from the original questionnaires not
		  included in the original published analyses. There was
		  limited evidence of departures from the proportional
		  hazards assumption. Flexible exposure-response models
		  provided some evidence of departures from linearity at both
		  low and high sulfate concentrations. Incorporating
		  information on changes over time in cigarette smoking and
		  body mass index had little effect on the association
		  between fine particles and mortality. There was limited
		  evidence of variation in risk with attained age, gender,
		  smoking status, occupational exposure to dust and fumes,
		  marital status, heart or lung diseases, or lung function.
		  However, air pollution risk did appear to decreasing with
		  increasing educational attainment. Extensive adjustment for
		  occupation using aggregate indices of occupational
		  "dirtiness" and occupational exposure to known lung
		  carcinogens had little impact on the mortality risks
		  associated with particulate air pollution. Our evaluation
		  of population mobility indicated that relatively few
		  subjects moved from their original city of residence.
		  Attempts to identify critical exposure time windows were
		  limited by the lack of marked interindividual variation in
		  temporal exposure patterns throughout the study period.
		  Overall, this extensive sensitivity analysis both supported
		  the conclusions reached by the original investigators and
		  demonstrated the robustness of these conclusions to
		  alternative analytic approaches.},

		  a critical role in the establishment of the current U.S.
		  ambient air quality objective for fine particles (PM(2.5)),
		  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, industry, and

		  reanalysis of this study to validate the original findings
		  reported by Dockery and colleagues in the New England
		  Journal of Medicine (vol. 329, pp. 1753-1759) in 1993.
		  Validation of the original findings was accomplished by a
		  detailed statistical audit and replication of original
		  results. With the exception of occupational exposure to
		  dust (14 discrepancies of 249 questionnaires located for
		  evaluation) and fumes (15/249), date of death (2/250), and
		  cause of death (2/250), the audit identified no
		  discrepancies between the original questionnaires and death
		  certificates in the audit sample and the analytic file used
		  by the original investigators. The data quality audit
		  identified a computer programming problem that had resulted
		  in early censorship in 5 of the 6 cities, which resulted in
		  the loss of approximately 1\% of the reported person-years
		  of follow-up; the reanalysis team updated the Six Cities
		  cohort to include the missing person-years of observation,
		  resulting in the addition of 928 person-years of
		  observation and 14 deaths. The reanalysis team was able to
		  reproduce virtually all of the original numerical results,
		  including the 26\% increase in all-cause mortality in the
		  most polluted city (Stubenville, OH) as compared to the
		  least polluted city (Portage, WI). The audit and validation
		  of the Harvard Six Cities Study conducted by the reanalysis
		  team generally confirmed the quality of the data and the
		  numerical results reported by the original investigators.
		  The discrepancies noted during the audit were not of
		  epidemiologic importance, and did not substantively alter
		  the original risk estimates associated with particulate air
		  pollution, nor the main conclusions reached by the original

		  regression and the case-crossover approach to test the
		  hypothesis. The effect of air pollution on daily mortality
		  of patients with congestive heart failure among residents
		  of Seoul, South Korea, during the period 1994--1998 was
		  compared with that of the general population in the same
		  area and the same period. The odds ratios and 95\%
		  confidence intervals (95\% CIs) estimated from general
		  additive models in the general population for an
		  interquartile range increase of particulate matter less
		  than 10 microm in diameter (42.1 microg/m(3)), carbon
		  monoxide (0.59 ppm), nitrogen dioxide (14.6 ppb), sulfur
		  dioxide (9.9 ppb), and ozone (20.5 ppb) were 1.014 (95\% CI
		  = 1.006- 1.022), 1.022 (95\% CI = 1.017- 1.029), 1.021
		  (95\% CI = 1.014- 1.029), 1.020 (95\% CI = 1.012--1.028),
		  and 1.010 (95\% CI = 1.002--1.017), respectively. The
		  estimated effects appeared larger among the congestive
		  heart failure patients than among the general population
		  (2.5 approximately 4.1 times higher depending on the
		  pollutants). The results from the case-crossover analysis
		  were similar. The finding of a stronger association in the
		  patients with congestive heart failure reinforces the
		  evidence that a harmful effect of air pollution is mediated
		  by cardiovascular mechanisms.},

  abstract	= {RATIONALE: A large body of epidemiologic literature has
		  found an association of increased fine particulate air
		  pollution (PM2.5) with acute and chronic mortality. The
		  effect of improvements in particle exposure is less clear.
		  OBJECTIVES: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities
		  adult cohort study showed an association between long-term
		  ambient PM2.5 and mortality between enrollment in the
		  mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990. We extended mortality
		  follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air pollution
		  concentrations. METHODS: Annual city-specific PM2.5
		  concentrations were measured between 1979 and 1988, and
		  estimated for later years from publicly available data.
		  Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during
		  the two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first
		  period and change between these periods, (3) overall mean
		  PM2.5 across the entire follow-up, and (4) year-specific
		  mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox
		  proportional hazards regression controlling for individual
		  risk factors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found an
		  increase in overall mortality associated with each 10
		  microg/m3 increase in PM2.5 modeled either as the overall
		  mean (rate ratio [RR], 1.16; 95\% confidence interval [CI],
		  1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (RR, 1.14;
		  95\% CI, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with
		  lung cancer (RR, 1.27; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.69) and
		  cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.44).
		  Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased
		  mean PM2.5 (10 microg/m3) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95\%
		  CI, 0.57-0.95). CONCLUSION: Total, cardiovascular, and lung
		  cancer mortality were each positively associated with
		  ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Reduced PM2.5 concentrations
		  were associated with reduced mortality risk.},

		  expected solely as a result of chance. This empirical study
		  showed that either unidirectional retrospective (selecting

		  usefulness of symmetric bidirectional control strategies.
		  We simulated true relative risks (RRs; true ss = 0.001) of
		  deaths of 1.051 per 50-ppb increase of sulfur dioxide and
		  included confounding by right- or left-skewed seasonal
		  waves, linear long-term time trends, or a combination of

		  approximately 1. 056 at either a long-term trend or any

		  risk using conditional logistic regression. In this
		  simulation study, we applied several control sampling
		  approaches to control for confounding by various temporal
		  patterns of an exposure variable and evaluated the
		  usefulness of symmetric bidirectional control strategies.
		  We simulated true relative risks (RRs; true ss = 0.001) of
		  deaths of 1.051 per 50-ppb increase of sulfur dioxide and
		  included confounding by right- or left-skewed seasonal
		  waves, linear long-term time trends, or a combination of
		  both. The range of the estimated RRs from symmetric
		  bidirectional control sampling approaches was 1.044
		  approximately 1. 056 at either a long-term trend or any
		  skewed seasonal wave of SO(2) levels, which indicated the
		  bidirectional control sampling methods would successfully
		  control confounding by design. The simulations with
		  bidirectional sampling, however, show that biases may occur
		  if waves are incomplete (20-43\% underestimated RRs). In
		  conclusion, our simulations show that the symmetric
		  bidirectional case-crossover design can substantially
		  control for confounding by linear long-term trends and/or
		  seasonality of an exposure variable by design as well.
		  However, unidirectional control sampling would fail to
		  control confounding by those variations of air pollution.
		  Simulation results also show that even the bidirectional

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Ecologic studies are commonly used to report
		  associations between short-term air pollution and
		  mortality. In such studies, the unit of observation is the
		  day rather than the individual. Moreover, individual data
		  on the subjects are rarely available, which limits the
		  assessment of individual risk factors. These associations
		  can also be investigated using case-crossover studies.
		  However, by definition, individual risk factors are not
		  studied, and such studies analyze only dead subjects, which
		  limits the statistical power. OBJECTIVE: We suggest that
		  the survival analysis is more suitable when cohorts are
		  examined with a time-dependent ecologic exposure. To our
		  knowledge, to date this type of analysis has never been
		  proposed. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, MEASUREMENTS: In the
		  present study we used a Cox proportional hazards model to
		  investigate the distribution over time of the short-term
		  effect of black smoke and sulfur dioxide in 439
		  nonaccidental and 158 cardiorespiratory deaths among the
		  1,469 subjects of the Personnes Ages QUID (PAQUID) cohort
		  in Bordeaux, France. The model has a delayed entry and a
		  polynomial distributed lag from 0 to 5 days. Results are
		  adjusted for individual risk factors, temperature, relative
		  humidity, weekday, season, influenza epidemics, and a time
		  function to control temporal trends. RESULTS: We identified
		  a positive and significant association between
		  cardiorespiratory mortality and black smoke, with a 24\%
		  increase in deaths 3 days after a 10-microg/m3 increase in
		  black smoke (95\% confidence interval, 4-47\%).
		  CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the Cox proportional hazards
		  model with time-dependent covariates is very suitable to
		  investigate simultaneously the short-term effect of air
		  pollution on health and the effect of individual risk
		  factors on a cohort study.},

		  association between ambient air pollution and
		  hospitalization for respiratory infections among children
		  who were younger than 15 years in Toronto during a 4-year
		  period (1998-2001). METHODS: Exposures averaged during
		  periods that varied from 1 to 7 days were used to assess
		  the effects of air pollutants, including thoracic
		  particulate matter (PM10), fine (PM2.5) and coarse
		  (PM10-2.5) particulate matter, carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur
		  dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), on
		  hospitalization for respiratory infections. A
		  case-crossover design was used to calculate odds ratios for
		  the hospitalization adjusted for daily weather conditions
		  with an incremented exposure corresponding to the
		  interquartile range in air pollution exposures.
		  RESULTS:When particulate matter and gaseous pollutants were
		  mutually taken into account, the effect remained pronounced
		  for PM10-2.5 in both boys and girls. The adjusted odds
		  ratio for 6-day average exposure to PM10-2.5 with an
		  increment of 6.5 microg/m3 was 1.15 (95\% confidence
		  interval: 1.02-1.30) for boys and 1.18 (95\% confidence
		  interval: 1.01-1.36) for girls. The effect also remained
		  for PM10 in boys and for NO2 in girls. PM2.5, CO, SO2, and
		  O3 showed no significant effects on hospitalization for
		  respiratory infection in both genders when other pollutants
		  were taken into consideration. CONCLUSION:Our study
		  suggested a detrimental effect of relatively low levels of
		  ambient particulate matter and gaseous pollutants,
		  especially coarse particulate matter and NO2, on
		  hospitalization for respiratory infections in children.},

  abstract	= {We propose a simple, fully Bayesian approach for
		  multivariate receptor modeling that allows for flexible and
		  consistent incorporation of a priori information. The model
		  uses a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution as the
		  prior distribution on source profiles that allows great
		  flexibility in the specification of prior information.
		  Heavy-tailed lognormal distributions are used as priors on
		  source contributions to match the nature of particulate
		  concentrations. A simulation study based on the Washington,
		  DC airshed shows that the model compares favorably to
		  Positive Matrix Factorization, a standard analysis approach
		  used for pollution source apportionment. A significant
		  advantage of the proposed approach compared to most
		  popularly used methods is that the Bayesian framework
		  yields complete distributional results for each parameter
		  of interest (including distributions for each element of
		  the source profile and source contribution matrices). These
		  distributions offer a great deal of power and versatility
		  when addressing complex questions of interest to the

  abstract	= {The case-crossover design was introduced in epidemiology
		  15 years ago as a method for studying the effects of a risk
		  factor on a health event using only cases. The idea is to
		  compare a case's exposure immediately prior to or during
		  the case-defining event with that same person's exposure at
		  otherwise similar "reference" times. An alternative
		  approach to the analysis of daily exposure and case-only
		  data is time series analysis. Here, log-linear regression
		  models express the expected total number of events on each
		  day as a function of the exposure level and potential
		  confounding variables. In time series analyses of air
		  pollution, smooth functions of time and weather are the
		  main confounders. Time series and case-crossover methods
		  are often viewed as competing methods. In this paper, we
		  show that case-crossover using conditional logistic
		  regression is a special case of time series analysis when
		  there is a common exposure such as in air pollution
		  studies. This equivalence provides computational
		  convenience for case-crossover analyses and a better
		  understanding of time series models. Time series log-linear
		  regression accounts for overdispersion of the Poisson
		  variance, while case-crossover analyses typically do not.
		  This equivalence also permits model checking for
		  case-crossover data using standard log-linear model
		  diagnostics.},

  abstract	= {This study is part of a larger research program to examine
		  the relationship between ambient air quality and health in
		  Windsor, Ontario, Canada. We assessed the association
		  between air pollution and daily respiratory hospitalization
		  for different age and sex groups from 1995 to 2000. The
		  pollutants included were nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide,
		  carbon monoxide, ozone, particulate matter 10 microm in
		  diameter (PM10), coefficient of haze (COH), and total
		  reduced sulfur (TRS). We calculated relative risk (RR)
		  estimates using both time-series and case-crossover methods
		  after controlling for appropriate confounders (temperature,
		  humidity, and change in barometric pressure). The results
		  of both analyses were consistent. We found associations
		  between NO2, SO2, CO, COH, or PM10 and daily hospital
		  admission of respiratory diseases especially among females.
		  For females 0-14 years of age, there was 1-day delayed
		  effect of NO2 (RR = 1.19, case-crossover method), a
		  current-day SO2 (RR = 1.11, time series), and current-day
		  and 1- and 2-day delayed effects for CO by case crossover
		  (RR = 1.15, 1.19, 1.22, respectively). Time-series analysis
		  showed that 1-day delayed effect of PM10 on respiratory
		  admissions of adult males (15-64 years of age), with an RR
		  of 1.18. COH had significant effects on female respiratory
		  hospitalization, especially for 2-day delayed effects on
		  adult females, with RRs of 1.15 and 1.29 using time-series
		  and case-crossover analysis, respectively. There were no
		  significant associations between O3 and TRS with
		  respiratory admissions. These findings provide policy
		  makers with current risks estimates of respiratory

  abstract	= {Recent epidemiological findings have suggested that urban
		  atmospheric pollution may have adverse effects on the
		  cardiovascular system as well as on the respiratory system.
		  We carried out an exhaustive search of published studies
		  investigating links between coronary heart disease and
		  urban atmospheric pollution. The review was conducted on
		  cited articles published between 1994 and 2005 and whose
		  main objective was to measure the risk of ischaemic heart
		  diseases related to urban pollution. Of the 236 references
		  identified, 46 epidemiological studies were selected for
		  analysis on the basis of pre-defined criteria. The studies
		  were analysed according to short-term effects (time series
		  and case-crossover designs) and long-term effects
		  (case-control and cohort studies). A link between coronary
		  heart disease and at least one of the pollutants studied
		  (PM10, O3, NOx, CO, SO2) emerged in 40 publications.
		  Particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide
		  were the pollutants most often linked with coronary heart
		  disease. The association was inconstant for O3. Although
		  the mean mortality or morbidity risk related to urban
		  atmospheric pollution is low compared with that associated
		  with other better-known risk factors, its impact on health
		  is nevertheless major because of the large number of people
		  who are exposed. This exhaustive review supports the
		  possibility that urban pollution is indeed an environmental
		  cardiovascular risk factor and should be considered as such
		  by the cardiologists.},

  abstract	= {A case-crossover study was conducted in 36 US cities to
		  evaluate the effect of ozone and particulate matter with an
		  aerodynamic diameter of < or =10 microm (PM10) on
		  respiratory hospital admissions and to identify which city
		  characteristics may explain the heterogeneity in risk
		  estimates. Respiratory hospital admissions and air
		  pollution data were obtained for 1986-1999. In a
		  meta-analysis based on the city-specific regression models,
		  several city characteristics were evaluated as effect
		  modifiers. During the warm season, the 2-day cumulative
		  effect of a 5-ppb increase in ozone was a 0.27\% (95\%
		  confidence interval (CI): 0.08, 0.47) increase in chronic
		  obstructive pulmonary disease admissions and a 0.41\% (95\%
		  CI: 0.26, 0.57) increase in pneumonia admissions.
		  Similarly, a 10-microg/m(3) increase in PM10 during the
		  warm season resulted in a 1.47\% (95\% CI: 0.93, 2.01)
		  increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at lag 1
		  and a 0.84\% (95\% CI: 0.50, 1.19) increase in pneumonia at
		  lag 0. Percentage of households with central air
		  conditioning reduced the effect of air pollution, and
		  variability of summer apparent temperature reduced the
		  effect of ozone on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
		  The study confirmed, in a large sample of cities, that
		  exposure to ozone and PM10 is associated with respiratory
		  hospital admissions and provided evidence that the effect
		  of air pollution is modified by certain city characteristics.},

  abstract	= {We describe two statistical designs that can provide
		  efficient estimates of the health effects of exposure to
		  air pollutants in epidemiologic studies. We also evaluate
		  the effects of measurement error in exposure assessment on
		  the accuracy of estimated health effects. The bidirectional
		  case-crossover design is a variant of a method proposed by
		  Maclure (1991). Our version of the method takes advantage
		  of the fact that in epidemiologic studies involving
		  environmental exposure, accurate information about past
		  exposure is more readily available, and that levels of
		  exposure are generally unaffected by the response of the
		  subject. It differs from other case-crossover methods in
		  that control information is assessed both before and after
		  failure, thus avoiding confounding due to time trends in
		  exposure. The multilevel analytic design provides a method
		  of combining estimates of health effects made on the
		  individual level with those made at the group level. It has
		  great potential value in situations where variations in
		  exposure within groups may not be great enough to provide
		  adequate power to detect health effects, as is often the
		  case in air pollution studies where exposure levels are
		  similar within a geographic community. Measurement errors
		  in exposure assessment can have substantial impact on the
		  accuracy of estimated health effects. When the
		  microenvironmental approach is used to estimate exposure, a
		  standard error of 30\% in estimating indoor/outdoor ratios
		  can increase the standard error of a relative risk estimate
		  by 50\%, and introduce bias as well. Similar results hold
		  when exposure is estimated with personal samplers. When the
		  microenvironmental approach is used, errors in estimating
		  indoor/outdoor ratios have more influence on the accuracy
		  of risk estimation than do errors in estimating the time
		  spent in microenvironments.},

  abstract	= {This study reassessed Schwartz and Dockery's analysis of
		  daily mortality from nonexternal causes among residents of
		  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, over 8 years, from 1973 to 1980
		  [American Review of Respiratory Disease 145:600-604
		  (1992)]. A Poisson regression analysis using the same model
		  found that a 100-microg/m(3) increment in the 48-hr mean
		  concentration of total suspended particulates (TSP) was
		  associated with increased all-cause mortality [rate ratio =
		  1.069; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.043-1.096) after
		  adjustment for quadratic trend, season, year, previous
		  day's mean temperature, dew point, winter temperature, and
		  indicators of hot (temperature > 80 degrees F) and humid
		  days (dew point > 66 degrees F). Critics suggested that
		  time-varying factors such as season and day of week were
		  not sufficiently controlled in this analysis and subsequent
		  studies in other locations. We used a conditional logistic
		  regression analysis with a case-crossover design to
		  reanalyze the data, with air pollution in the prior and
		  subsequent weeks to the day of death serving as referent
		  periods. The case-crossover approach controls for season
		  and day of week by design rather than modeling. We found
		  that a 100-microg/m(3) increment in the 48-hr mean level of
		  TSP was associated with increased all-cause mortality [odds
		  ratio (OR) = 1.056; CI, 1.027-1.086) after adjustment for
		  the same weather variables as above. Similar associations
		  were observed for deaths in individuals over 65 years of
		  age (OR = 1.074; CI, 1. 037-1.111) and for deaths due to
		  cardiovascular disease (OR = 1.063; CI, 1.021-1.107). The
		  current case-crossover analysis confirms the general
		  conclusion of the previous Poisson regression analysis of
		  an association of TSP with daily mortality in Philadelphia,
		  Pennsylvania.},

  abstract	= {Limited evidence suggests that persons with conditions
		  such as diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure,
		  and respiratory conditions may be at increased risk of
		  adverse cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated
		  with ambient air pollution. The authors collected data on
		  over 4 million emergency department visits from 31
		  hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia, between January 1993 and
		  August 2000. Visits for cardiovascular disease were
		  examined in relation to levels of ambient pollutants by use
		  of a case-crossover framework. Heterogeneity of risk was
		  examined for several comorbid conditions. The results
		  included evidence of stronger associations of dysrhythmia
		  and congestive heart failure visits with comorbid
		  hypertension in relation to increased air pollution levels
		  compared with visits without comorbid hypertension; similar
		  evidence of effect modification by diabetes and chronic
		  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was observed for
		  dysrhythmia and peripheral and cerebrovascular disease
		  visits, respectively. Evidence of effect modification by
		  comorbid hypertension and diabetes was observed in relation
		  to particulate matter less than 10 microm in aerodynamic
		  diameter, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, while
		  evidence of effect modification by comorbid COPD was also
		  observed in response to ozone levels. These findings
		  provide further evidence of increased susceptibility to
		  adverse cardiovascular events associated with ambient air
		  pollution among persons with hypertension, diabetes, and
		  COPD.},

  abstract	= {Time series models relating short-term changes in air
		  pollution levels to daily mortality counts typically assume
		  that the effects of air pollution on the log relative rate
		  of mortality do not vary with time. However, these
		  short-term effects might plausibly vary by season. Changes
		  in the sources of air pollution and meteorology can result
		  in changes in characteristics of the air pollution mixture
		  across seasons. The authors developed Bayesian
		  semiparametric hierarchical models for estimating
		  time-varying effects of pollution on mortality in multisite
		  time series studies. The methods were applied to the
		  database of the National Morbidity and Mortality Air
		  Pollution Study, which includes data for 100 US cities, for
		  the period 1987-2000. At the national level, a
		  10-microg/m(3) increase in particulate matter less than 10
		  microm in aerodynamic diameter at a 1-day lag was
		  associated with 0.15\% (95\% posterior interval (PI):

		  increases in mortality for winter, spring, summer, and
		  fall, respectively. An analysis by geographic region found
		  a strong seasonal pattern in the Northeast (with a peak in
		  summer) and little seasonal variation in the southern
		  regions of the country. These results provide useful
		  information for understanding particle toxicity and guiding

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Elevated concentrations of ambient particulate
		  air pollution have been associated with increased hospital
		  admissions for cardiovascular disease. Whether high
		  concentrations of ambient particles can trigger the onset
		  of acute myocardial infarction (MI), however, remains
		  unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We interviewed 772 patients
		  with MI in the greater Boston area between January 1995 and
		  May 1996 as part of the Determinants of Myocardial
		  Infarction Onset Study. Hourly concentrations of particle
		  mass <2.5 microm (PM(2.5)), carbon black, and gaseous air
		  pollutants were measured. A case-crossover approach was
		  used to analyze the data for evidence of triggering. The
		  risk of MI onset increased in association with elevated
		  concentrations of fine particles in the previous 2-hour
		  period. In addition, a delayed response associated with
		  24-hour average exposure 1 day before the onset of symptoms
		  was observed. Multivariate analyses considering both time
		  windows jointly revealed an estimated odds ratio of 1.48
		  associated with an increase of 25 microg/m(3) PM(2.5)
		  during a 2-hour period before the onset and an odds ratio
		  of 1.69 for an increase of 20 microg/m(3) PM(2.5) in the
		  24-hour period 1 day before the onset (95\% CIs 1.09, 2.02
		  and 1.13, 2.34, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The present
		  study suggests that elevated concentrations of fine
		  particles in the air may transiently elevate the risk of
		  MIs within a few hours and 1 day after exposure. Further
		  studies in other locations are needed to clarify the
		  importance of this potentially preventable trigger of MI.},

		  traffic in urban areas and the exacerbation of
		  cardiovascular disease has been suggested in previous
		  studies. This study was designed to assess whether exposure
		  to traffic can trigger myocardial infarction. METHODS: We
		  conducted a case-crossover study in which cases of
		  myocardial infarction were identified with the use of data
		  from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of
		  Augsburg Myocardial Infarction Registry in Augsburg, in
		  southern Germany, for the period from February 1999 to July
		  2001. There were 691 subjects for whom the date and time of
		  the myocardial infarction were known who had survived for
		  at least 24 hours after the event, completed the registry's
		  standardized interview, and provided information on factors
		  that may have triggered the myocardial infarction. Data on
		  subjects' activities during the four days preceding the
		  onset of symptoms were collected with the use of patient
		  diaries. RESULTS: An association was found between exposure
		  to traffic and the onset of a myocardial infarction within
		  one hour afterward (odds ratio, 2.92; 95 percent confidence
		  interval, 2.22 to 3.83; P<0.001). The time the subjects
		  spent in cars, on public transportation, or on motorcycles
		  or bicycles was consistently linked with an increase in the
		  risk of myocardial infarction. Adjusting for the level of
		  exercise on a bicycle or for getting up in the morning
		  changed the estimated effect of exposure to traffic only
		  slightly (odds ratio for myocardial infarction, 2.73; 95
		  percent confidence interval, 2.06 to 3.61; P<0.001). The
		  subject's use of a car was the most common source of
		  exposure to traffic; nevertheless, there was also an
		  association between time spent on public transportation and
		  the onset of a myocardial infarction one hour later.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Transient exposure to traffic may increase the
		  risk of myocardial infarction in susceptible persons.},

		  pollution have been associated with exacerbation of
		  cardiovascular disease. A multi-city study was designed to
		  assess the probability of recurrent hospitalization in a
		  cohort of incident myocardial infarction survivors in five
		  European cities. The objective of this paper is to discuss
		  the methods for analyzing short-term health effects in a
		  cohort study based on a case-series. METHODS: Three methods
		  were considered for the analyses of the cohort data:
		  Poisson regression approach, case-crossover analyses and
		  extended Cox regression analyses. The major challenge of
		  these analyses is to appropriately consider changes within
		  the cohort over time due to changes in the underlying risk
		  following a myocardial infarction, slow time trends in risk
		  factors within the population, dynamic cohort size and
		  seasonal variation. RESULTS: Poisson regression analyses,
		  case-crossover analyses and Extended Cox regression
		  analyses gave similar results. Application of smoothing
		  methods showed the capability to adequately model the
		  complex time trends. CONCLUSION: From a practical point of
		  view, Poisson regression analyses are less time-consuming,
		  and therefore might be used for confounder selection and
		  most of the analyses. However, replication of the results
		  with Cox models is desirable to assure that the results are
		  independent of the analytical approach used. In addition,
		  extended Cox regression analyses would allow a joint
		  estimation of long-term and short-term health effects of
		  time-varying exposures.},

		  particulate air pollution have been less conclusive.
		  OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between long-term
		  exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause,
		  lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. DESIGN,
		  SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Vital status and cause of death
		  data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part
		  of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective
		  mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million
		  adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire
		  detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race,
		  weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status,
		  diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The
		  risk factor data for approximately 500 000 adults were
		  linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas
		  throughout the United States and combined with vital status
		  and cause of death data through December 31, 1998. MAIN
		  OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause, lung cancer, and
		  cardiopulmonary mortality. RESULTS: Fine particulate and
		  sulfur oxide--related pollution were associated with
		  all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each
		  10-microg/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution
		  was associated with approximately a 4\%, 6\%, and 8\%
		  increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung
		  cancer mortality, respectively. Measures of coarse particle
		  fraction and total suspended particles were not
		  consistently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION:
		  Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate
		  air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for
		  cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality.},

		  exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (PM) to
		  broad cause-of-death mortality. Associations with specific
		  cardiopulmonary diseases might be useful in exploring
		  potential mechanistic pathways linking exposure and
		  mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: General pathophysiological
		  pathways linking long-term PM exposure with mortality and
		  expected patterns of PM mortality with specific causes of
		  death were proposed a priori. Vital status, risk factor,
		  and cause-of-death data, collected by the American Cancer
		  Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, were
		  linked with air pollution data from United States
		  metropolitan areas. Cox Proportional Hazard regression
		  models were used to estimate PM-mortality associations with
		  specific causes of death. Long-term PM exposures were most
		  strongly associated with mortality attributable to ischemic
		  heart disease, dysrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac
		  arrest. For these cardiovascular causes of death, a
		  10-microg/m3 elevation in fine PM was associated with 8\%
		  to 18\% increases in mortality risk, with comparable or
		  larger risks being observed for smokers relative to
		  nonsmokers. Mortality attributable to respiratory disease
		  had relatively weak associations. CONCLUSIONS: Fine
		  particulate air pollution is a risk factor for
		  cause-specific cardiovascular disease mortality via
		  mechanisms that likely include pulmonary and systemic
		  inflammation, accelerated atherosclerosis, and altered
		  cardiac autonomic function. Although smoking is a much
		  larger risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality,
		  exposure to fine PM imposes additional effects that seem to
		  be at least additive to if not synergistic with smoking.},

		  exposure to particulate air pollution contributes to
		  pulmonary and systemic oxidative stress, inflammation,
		  progression of atherosclerosis, and risk of ischemic heart
		  disease and death. Short-term exposure may contribute to
		  complications of atherosclerosis, such as plaque
		  vulnerability, thrombosis, and acute ischemic events. These
		  findings are inconclusive and controversial and require
		  further study. This study evaluates the role of short-term
		  particulate exposure in triggering acute ischemic heart
		  disease events. METHODS AND RESULTS: A case-crossover study
		  design was used to analyze ischemic events in 12,865
		  patients who lived on the Wasatch Front in Utah. Patients
		  were drawn from the cardiac catheterization registry of the
		  Intermountain Heart Collaborative Study, a large, ongoing
		  registry of patients who underwent coronary arteriography
		  and were followed up longitudinally. Ambient fine
		  particulate pollution (particles with an aerodynamic
		  diameter < or = 2.5 microm; PM2.5) elevated by 10 microg/m3
		  was associated with increased risk of acute ischemic
		  coronary events (unstable angina and myocardial infarction)
		  equal to 4.5\% (95\% confidence interval, 1.1 to 8.0).
		  Effects were larger for those with angiographically
		  demonstrated coronary artery disease. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Short-term particulate exposures contributed to acute
		  coronary events, especially among patients with underlying
		  coronary artery disease. Individuals with stable
		  presentation and those with angiographically demonstrated
		  clean coronaries are not as susceptible to short-term

  abstract	= {This article evaluates the dynamic exposure-response
		  relationship between particulate matter air pollution (PM)
		  and mortality risk by integrating epidemiological evidence
		  from studies that use different time scales of exposure.
		  The evidence suggests that short-term exposure studies are
		  observing more than just harvesting or mortality
		  displacement. There is little evidence of short-term
		  compensatory reduction in deaths, and estimated PM effects
		  are generally larger for intermediate and longer term time
		  scales of exposure. Although proximity in time matters,
		  with most recent exposure having the largest health impact,
		  there is evidence that the short-term exposure studies
		  capture only a small amount of the overall health effects
		  of long-term repeated exposure to PM. The overall
		  epidemiological evidence suggests that adverse health
		  effects are dependent on both exposure concentrations and
		  length of exposure, and that long-term exposures have
		  larger, more persistent cumulative effects than short-term
		  exposures.},

  abstract	= {Recent research appropriately suggests that caution is
		  warranted when interpreting long-term trends of improving
		  air quality and trends in reduced mortality rates as causal
		  because of concerns about confounding. The use of long-term
		  time trends as the primary source of exposure variability,
		  however, has been avoided in most air pollution
		  epidemiology studies. Multiple studies, using different
		  study designs that exploit various temporal and spatial
		  dimensions of exposure variability, have observed
		  reasonably consistent and coherent associations between
		  particulate air pollution and cardiopulmonary health. It's
		  possible that these air pollution studies have experienced
		  "epidemiological bad luck" with multiple confounders that
		  are inadequately controlled for and coincidentally cause
		  spurious correlations that are coherent across the
		  different study designs. To be consistent with the overall
		  epidemiologic results, these confounders must correlate
		  with pollution across various dimensions of time and space
		  and be stronger risk factors for cardiopulmonary disease
		  than for other disease. The more likely explanation of
		  recent air pollution epidemiology is that air pollution,
		  especially fine particulate and related pollution, has
		  measurable effects on cardiopulmonary health.},

  abstract	= {We investigated the relationship between air pollution and
		  incidence of cardiac arrhythmia in a study of patients with
		  implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Thirty-four
		  patients (ages 15-85 yr, 80\% male) with ICDs residing in
		  the Vancouver, Canada, area were included in the analyses,
		  representing all patients attending the 2 ICD clinics in
		  the study region who had recorded at least 1 ICD discharge
		  during the 14 February to 31 December 2000 study period.
		  Air pollutant (PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(4)(2-), elemental carbon
		  [EC], organic carbon [OC], O(3), SO(2), NO(2), and CO)
		  concentrations on days for which ICD discharges were
		  observed ("case days") were compared to concentrations on
		  control days in case-crossover analyses. Control days were
		  selected symmetrically, 7 days before and after each case
		  day. ICD discharges occurring within 72 h of 1 another were
		  grouped and considered as 1 discharge event. Temperature,
		  relative humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, and wind
		  speed were included simultaneously as covariates.
		  Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of grouping ICD
		  discharges, of including meteorological variables, and of
		  excluding discharges that were considered inappropriate by
		  a cardiologist. As in previous studies, mean concentrations
		  and interquartile ranges of air pollutants in Vancouver
		  were low (e.g., PM(2.5) mean = 8.2 microg/m(3)). Although
		  in general there were no statistically significant results,
		  there were trends that might indicate associations between
		  pollutants and ICD discharges. Odds ratios (OR) were
		  consistently higher in summer than in winter (e.g., lag 0
		  per interquartile range increase in EC: 1.09 [0.86-1.37]
		  vs. 0.61 [0.31-1.18]) and, in general, the highest ORs were
		  observed for same-day effects. The one major exception was
		  the observation of high ORs for ozone in winter (e.g., lag
		  1: 2.27 [0.67-7.66]). While an OR of 1.55 (0.51-4.70) was
		  observed in summer at lag 0 for PM(10), no indications of
		  positive associations were observed for PM(2.5) or
		  SO(4)(2-). For indicators of local combustion-source
		  pollution, EC, OC, CO, and SO(2), ORs were elevated at all
		  lags (0-3 days) in summer. In summary, this study provides
		  little evidence that specific components of PM affect risk
		  of cardiac arrhythmias, although power limited the ability
		  of the study to detect small effects.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: It has previously been reported that the risk
		  of ventricular arrhythmias is positively associated with
		  ambient air pollution among patients with implantable
		  cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) in Boston. AIMS: To
		  assess the association of community exposures to air
		  pollution with ventricular arrhythmias in a cohort of ICD
		  patients in metropolitan St Louis, Missouri. METHODS: ICD
		  detected episodes reported during clinical follow up were
		  abstracted and reviewed by an electrophysiologist to
		  identify ventricular arrhythmias. A total of 139
		  ventricular arrhythmias were identified among 56 patients.
		  A case-crossover design was used with control periods
		  matched on weekday and hour of the day within the same
		  calendar month. Conditional logistic regression models were
		  adjusted for temperature, barometric pressure, and relative
		  humidity in the 24 hours preceding the event. RESULTS:
		  There was a significant (24\%, 95\% CI 7\% to 44\%)
		  increase in risk of ventricular arrhythmias associated with
		  each 5 ppb increase in mean sulphur dioxide and
		  non-significantly increased risk (22\%, 95\% CI -6\% to
		  60\%; and 18\%, 95\% CI -7\% to 50\%) associated with
		  increases in nitrogen dioxide (6 ppb) and elemental carbon
		  (0.5 microg/m3), respectively in the 24 hours before the
		  arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence of
		  an association between ventricular arrhythmias and ambient
		  air pollutants in St Louis. This is consistent with
		  previous results from Boston, although the pollutants
		  responsible for the increased risk are different.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVES: We reported previously that 24-hr moving
		  average ambient air pollution concentrations were
		  positively associated with ventricular arrhythmias detected
		  by implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). ICDs
		  also detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes (PAF)
		  that result in rapid ventricular rates. In this same cohort
		  of ICD patients, we assessed the association between
		  ambient air pollution and episodes of PAF. DESIGN: We
		  performed a case-crossover study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients
		  who lived in the Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area
		  and who had ICDs implanted between June 1995 and December
		  1999 (n=203) were followed until July 2002.
		  EVALUATIONS/MEASUREMENTS: We used conditional logistic
		  regression to explore the association between community air
		  pollution and 91 electrophysiologist-confirmed episodes of
		  PAF among 29 subjects. RESULTS: We found a statistically
		  significant positive association between episodes of PAF
		  and increased ozone concentration (22 ppb) in the hour
		  before the arrhythmia (odds ratio=2.08; 95\% confidence
		  interval=1.22, 3.54; p=0.001). The risk estimate for a
		  longer (24-hr) moving average was smaller, thus suggesting
		  an immediate effect. Positive but not statistically
		  significant risks were associated with fine particles,
		  nitrogen dioxide, and black carbon. CONCLUSIONS: Increased
		  ambient O3 pollution was associated with increased risk of
		  episodes of rapid ventricular response due to PAF, thereby
		  suggesting that community air pollution may be a
		  precipitant of these events.},

  abstract	= {RATIONALE: Although short-term exposure to air pollution
		  has been associated with acute, reversible lung function
		  decrements, the impact of long-term exposure has not been
		  well established. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association
		  between long-term exposure to ozone (O(3)), particulate
		  matter less than 10 mum in diameter (PM(10)), and nitrogen
		  dioxide (NO(2)) and lung function growth in Mexico City
		  schoolchildren. METHODS: A dynamic cohort of 3,170 children
		  aged 8 years at baseline was followed from April 23, 1996,
		  through May 19, 1999. The children attended 39 randomly
		  selected elementary schools located near 10 air quality
		  monitoring stations and were visited every 6 months.
		  Statistical analyses were performed using general linear
		  mixed models. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After
		  adjusting for acute exposure and other potential
		  confounding factors, deficits in FVC and FEV(1) growth over
		  the 3-year follow-up period were significantly associated
		  with exposure to O(3), PM(10), and NO(2). In multipollutant
		  models, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in mean O(3)
		  concentration (IQR, 11.3 ppb) was associated with an annual
		  deficit in FEV(1) of 12 ml in girls and 4 ml in boys, an
		  IQR range (IQR, 36.4 microg/m(3)) increase in PM(10) with
		  an annual deficit in FEV(1) of 11 ml in girls and 15 ml in
		  boys, and an IQR range (IQR, 12.0 ppb) increase in NO(2)
		  with an annual deficit in FEV(1) of 30 ml in girls and 25
		  ml in boys. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that long-term
		  exposure to O(3), PM(10), and NO(2) is associated with a
		  deficit in FVC and FEV(1) growth among schoolchildren
		  living in Mexico City.},

  abstract	= {Studies link air pollution with increased mortality;
		  however, information on infants is scarce and inconclusive.
		  OBJECTIVE: We studied short-term PM10 exposure, relating to
		  increased respiratory-related infant mortality, and
		  estimated for poor living conditions. METHODS: A
		  case-crossover approach modeled the relationship between
		  infant mortality (1 month-1 year of age), and ambient PM10
		  levels on days before death in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico
		  (1997-2001). Socioeconomic level (SES) of the deceased was
		  defined by residence location. RESULTS: Overall air
		  pollutants did not affect infant mortality (odds ratio [OR]
		  = 1.02, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94-1.11 for PM10,
		  lag1) but low SES increased risk. Each 20 microg/m3 in PM10
		  (24-hour average, lag1, cumulative over 2 previous days)
		  increased respiratory-related mortality (OR = 1.61, 95\% CI
		  = 0.97-2.66; OR = 2.56; 95\% CI = 1.06-6.17, respectively).
		  Ozone levels did not affect infant mortality for any SES.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Worse living conditions among lower SES
		  concurred with increased mortality.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Despite the diversity of the studied health
		  outcomes, types and levels of pollution, and various
		  environmental settings, there is substantial evidence for a
		  positive link between urban air pollution and
		  cardiovascular diseases. The objective of this study was to
		  test the associations between air pollutants and the
		  occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS
		  AND RESULTS: Pollutant concentrations (SO2, NO2, and O3)
		  were measured hourly as part of the automated air quality
		  network. Since 1985, an AMI registry (the Toulouse MONICA
		  Project) has been collecting data in the southwest of
		  France. All cases of AMI and sudden and probable cardiac
		  deaths are recorded for subjects 35 to 64 years of age. We
		  studied the short-term exposure effect of pollution on the
		  risk of AMI (from January 1, 1997, to June 30, 1999) using
		  a case-crossover design method. We performed a conditional
		  logistic regression analysis to calculate relative risks
		  (RRs) and their 95\% CIs. After adjustment for temperature,
		  relative humidity, and influenza epidemics, the RRs (for an
		  increase of 5 microg/m3 of O3 concentration) for AMI
		  occurrence were significant for the current-day and
		  1-day-lag measurements (RR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.08;
		  P=0.009; and RR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.09; P=0.007,
		  respectively). Subjects 55 to 64 years of age with no
		  personal history of ischemic heart disease were the most
		  susceptible to develop an AMI (RR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.06 to
		  1.23). NO2 and SO2 exposures were not significantly
		  associated with the occurrence of AMI. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Observational data confirm that short-term O3 exposure
		  within a period of 1 to 2 days is related to acute coronary
		  events in middle-aged adults without heart disease, whereas
		  NO2 and SO2 are not.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic time-series studies conducted in
		  a number of cities have identified, in general, an
		  association between daily changes in concentration of
		  ambient particulate matter (PM) and daily number of deaths
		  (mortality). Increased hospitalization (a measure of
		  morbidity) among the elderly for specific causes has also
		  been associated with PM. These studies have raised concerns
		  about public health effects of particulate air pollution
		  and have contributed to regulatory decisions in the United
		  States. However, scientists have pointed out uncertainties
		  that raise questions about the interpretation of these
		  studies. One limitation to previous time-series studies of
		  PM and adverse health effects is that the evidence for an
		  association is derived from studies conducted in single
		  locations using diverse analytic methods. Statistical
		  procedures have been used to combine the results of these
		  single location studies in order to produce a summary

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Air pollution in cities has been linked to
		  increased rates of mortality and morbidity in developed and
		  developing countries. Although these findings have helped
		  lead to a tightening of air-quality standards, their
		  validity with respect to public health has been questioned.
		  METHODS: We assessed the effects of five major outdoor-air
		  pollutants on daily mortality rates in 20 of the largest
		  cities and metropolitan areas in the United States from
		  1987 to 1994. The pollutants were particulate matter that
		  is less than 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10),
		  ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen
		  dioxide. We used a two-stage analytic approach that pooled
		  data from multiple locations. RESULTS: After taking into
		  account potential confounding by other pollutants, we found
		  consistent evidence that the level of PM10 is associated
		  with the rate of death from all causes and from
		  cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. The estimated
		  increase in the relative rate of death from all causes was
		  0.51 percent (95 percent posterior interval, 0.07 to 0.93
		  percent) for each increase in the PM10 level of 10 microg
		  per cubic meter. The estimated increase in the relative
		  rate of death from cardiovascular and respiratory causes
		  was 0.68 percent (95 percent posterior interval, 0.20 to
		  1.16 percent) for each increase in the PM10 level of 10
		  microg per cubic meter. There was weaker evidence that
		  increases in ozone levels increased the relative rates of
		  death during the summer, when ozone levels are highest, but
		  not during the winter. Levels of the other pollutants were
		  not significantly related to the mortality rate.
		  CONCLUSIONS: There is consistent evidence that the levels
		  of fine particulate matter in the air are associated with
		  the risk of death from all causes and from cardiovascular
		  and respiratory illnesses. These findings strengthen the
		  rationale for controlling the levels of respirable
		  particles in outdoor air.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Interest in the health effects of particulate
		  matter (PM) has focused on identifying sources of PM,
		  including biomass burning, power plants, and gasoline and
		  diesel emissions that may be associated with adverse health
		  risks. Few epidemiologic studies, however, have included
		  source-apportionment estimates in their examinations of PM
		  health effects. We analyzed a time-series of chemically
		  speciated PM measurements in Atlanta, Georgia, and
		  conducted an epidemiologic analysis using data from three
		  distinct source-apportionment methods. OBJECTIVE: The key
		  objective of this analysis was to compare epidemiologic
		  findings generated using both factor analysis and mass
		  balance source-apportionment methods. METHODS: We analyzed
		  data collected between November 1998 and December 2002
		  using positive-matrix factorization (PMF), modified
		  chemical mass balance (CMB-LGO), and a tracer approach.
		  Emergency department (ED) visits for a combined
		  cardiovascular (CVD) and respiratory disease (RD) group
		  were assessed as end points. We estimated the risk ratio
		  (RR) associated with same day PM concentrations using
		  Poisson generalized linear models. RESULTS: There were
		  significant, positive associations between same-day PM(2.5)
		  (PM with aero-dynamic diameter <or= 2.5 microm)
		  concentrations attributed to mobile sources (RR range,
		  1.018-1.025) and biomass combustion, primarily prescribed
		  forest burning and residential wood combustion, (RR range,
		  1.024-1.033) source categories and CVD-related ED visits.
		  Associations between the source categories and RD visits
		  were not significant for all models except sulfate-rich
		  secondary PM(2.5) (RR range, 1.012-1.020). Generally, the
		  epidemiologic results were robust to the selection of
		  source-apportionment method, with strong agreement between
		  the RR estimates from the PMF and CMB-LGO models, as well
		  as with results from models using single-species tracers as
		  surrogates of the source-apportioned PM(2.5) values.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences among the
		  source-apportionment methods, these findings suggest that
		  modeled source-apportioned data can produce robust
		  estimates of acute health risk. In Atlanta, there were
		  consistent associations across methods between PM(2.5) from
		  mobile sources and biomass burning with both cardiovascular
		  and respiratory ED visits, and between sulfate-rich
		  secondary PM(2.5) with respiratory visits.},

		  (within 2 ppb), or carbon monoxide (within 0.03 ppm). The

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have reported that day-to-day
		  changes in particulate air pollution are associated with
		  day-to-day changes in deaths. Recently, several reports
		  have indicated that the software used to control for season
		  and weather in some of these studies had deficiencies.
		  AIMS: To investigate the use of the case-crossover design
		  as an alternative. METHODS: This approach compares the
		  exposure of each case to their exposure on a nearby day,
		  when they did not die. Hence it controls for seasonal
		  patterns and for all slowly varying covariates (age,
		  smoking, etc) by matching rather than complex modelling. A
		  key feature is that temperature can also be controlled by
		  matching. This approach was applied to a study of 14 US
		  cities. Weather and day of the week were controlled for in
		  the regression. RESULTS: A 10 microg/m3 increase in PM10
		  was associated with a 0.36\% increase in daily deaths from
		  internal causes (95\% CI 0.22\% to 0.50\%). Results were
		  little changed if, instead of symmetrical sampling of
		  control days the time stratified method was applied, when
		  control days were matched on temperature, or when more lags
		  of winter time temperatures were used. Similar results were
		  found using a Poisson regression, but the case-crossover
		  method has the advantage of simplicity in modelling, and of
		  combining matched strata across multiple locations in a
		  single stage analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the
		  considerable differences in analytical design, the
		  previously reported associations of particles with
		  mortality persisted in this study. The association appeared
		  quite linear. Case-crossover designs represent an
		  attractive method to control for season and weather by
		  matching.},

  abstract	= {RATIONALE: Air pollution has been associated with changes
		  in daily mortality. OBJECTIVES: Generally, studies use
		  Poisson regression, with complicated modeling strategies,
		  to control for season and weather, raising concerns that
		  the results may be sensitive to these modeling protocols.
		  For studies of ozone, weather control is a particular
		  problem because high ozone days are generally quite hot.
		  METHODS: The case-crossover approach converts this problem
		  into a case-control study, where the control for each
		  person is the same person on a day near in time, when he or
		  she did not die. This method controls for season and
		  individual risk factors by matching. One can also choose
		  the control day to have the same temperature as the event
		  day. MEASUREMENTS: I have applied this approach to a study
		  of more than 1 million deaths in 14 U.S. cities. MAIN
		  RESULTS: I found that, with matching on temperature, a
		  10-ppb increase in maximum hourly ozone concentrations was
		  associated with a 0.23\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]
		  0.01\%, 0.44\%) increase in the risk of dying. This finding
		  was indistinguishable from the risk when only matching on
		  season and controlling for temperature with regression
		  splines (0.19\%; 95\% CI 03\%, 0.35\%). Control for
		  suspended particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter
		  of 10 mum or less (PM(10)) did not change this risk.
		  However, the association was restricted to the warm months
		  (0.37\% increase; 95\% CI 0.11\%, 0.62\%), with no effect
		  in the cold months. CONCLUSIONS: The association between
		  ozone and mortality risk is unlikely to be caused by
		  confounding by temperature.},

		  It is not known why some previously healthy infants, when

		  have only mild symptoms. Our study aimed to evaluate the
		  possible association between emergency hospital visits for
		  bronchiolitis and air pollution in the Paris region during
		  four winter seasons. We included children under the age of
		  3 years who attended emergency room services for
		  bronchiolitis (following standardized definition) during
		  the period 1997-2001. Two series of data from 34 hospitals,
		  the daily number of emergency hospital consultations
		  (n=50857) and the daily number of hospitalizations
		  (n=16588) for bronchiolitis, were analyzed using
		  alternative statistical methods; these were the generalized
		  additive model (GAM) and case-crossover models. After
		  adjustments for public holidays, holidays and
		  meteorological variables the case-crossover model showed
		  that PM(10), BS, SO(2) and NO(2) were positively associated

  abstract	= {A limitation of most air pollution health effects studies
		  is that they rely on monitoring data averaged over one or
		  more ambient monitors to represent daily air pollution
		  exposures for individuals. Such data analyses therefore
		  implicitly require the assumption of a homogeneous spatial
		  distribution for particulate matter (PM). This assumption
		  may be suspected in the Pacific Northwest because of its
		  hilly topography and local variations in wood burning. To
		  examine the bias from substituting regional PM (i.e., the
		  average of three ambient monitor measurements) for
		  individual PM exposure, we conducted an exposure substudy
		  to identify the influence of location factors, specifically
		  urban versus suburban classification and topographic
		  features ("upstream" versus "downstream"), on local ambient
		  measurements. Using nephelometer measurements collected
		  over 1 year in four locations, we developed regression
		  models to predict local PM as a function of regional PM,
		  atmospheric stagnation, temperature, and location. We found
		  a significant interaction between atmospheric stagnation
		  and topography, with the most upstream site having reduced
		  PM levels on high stagnation days after controlling for
		  regional PM. We also found a significant interaction with
		  temperature at one downstream site thought to be heavily
		  exposed to wood smoke in the winter. These results are
		  consistent with the physics of surface radiation
		  inversions. The interactions reordered the index versus
		  referent exposures in a case-crossover analysis of
		  out-of-hospital primary cardiac arrest for subjects living
		  in specific locations, but did not meaningfully change the
		  associations with PM from the analysis using regional PM as
		  the exposure. The lack of change in these results may be
		  due to limitations in the data used to correct the exposure
		  estimates or to the absence of a PM effect among persons
		  without prior heart disease who experienced a primary
		  cardiac arrest.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Although studies have documented increased
		  mortality during heat waves, little information is
		  available on the subgroups most susceptible to these
		  effects. We evaluated the effects of summertime high
		  temperature on daily mortality among population subgroups
		  defined by demographic characteristics, socioeconomic
		  status, and episodes of hospitalization for various
		  conditions during the preceding 2 years. METHODS: We
		  studied a total of 205,019 residents of 4 Italian cities
		  (Bologna, Milan, Rome, and Turin) age 35 or older who died
		  during 1997-2003. The case-crossover design was applied to
		  evaluate the association between mean apparent temperature
		  (same and previous day) and all-cause mortality. Pooled
		  odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of
		  dying at 30 degrees C (apparent temperature) relative to 20
		  degrees C were estimated accounting for time, population
		  changes, and air pollution. RESULTS: We found an overall OR
		  of 1.34 (CI = 1.27-1.42) at 30 degrees C relative to 20
		  degrees C. The odds ratio increased with age and was higher
		  among women (OR = 1.45; 1.37-1.52) and among widows and
		  widowers (1.50; 1.33-1.69). Low area-based income modestly
		  increased the effect. Among the preexisting medical
		  conditions investigated, effect modification was detected
		  for previous psychiatric disorders (1.69; 1.39-2.07),
		  depression (1.72; 1.24-2.39), heart conduction disorders
		  (1.77; 1.38-2.27), and circulatory disorders of the brain
		  (1.47; 1.34-1.62). Temperature-related mortality was higher
		  among people residing in nursing homes, and a large effect
		  was also detected for hospitalized subjects. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Subsets of the population that are particularly vulnerable
		  to high summer temperatures include the elderly, women,
		  widows and widowers, those with selected medical
		  conditions, and those staying in nursing homes and
		  healthcare facilities.},

		  in the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and myocardial
		  infarction (MI) associated with increases in short-term and
		  daily levels of fine-particulate matter air pollution,
		  suggesting a role for particulate matter in triggering an
		  MI. METHODS: We studied the association between onset time
		  of MI and preceding hourly measures of fine-particulate
		  matter using a case-crossover study of 5793 confirmed cases
		  of acute MI. We linked data from a community-wide database
		  on acute MI from 1988-1994 in King County, Washington, with
		  central site air pollution monitoring data on
		  fine-particulate matter determined by nephelometry. We
		  compared air pollution exposure levels averaged 1 hour, 2
		  hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours before MI onset to a set of
		  time-stratified referent exposures from the same day of the
		  week in the month of the case event. RESULTS:: The
		  estimated relative risk for a 10-microg/m increase in
		  fine-particulate matter the hour before MI onset was 1.01
		  (95\% CI=0.98-1.05). Analyses of pollutant levels at the
		  other time points demonstrated a similar lack of
		  association. No increased risk was found in all cases with
		  preexisting cardiac disease (odds ratio = 1.05; 0.95-1.16).
		  Stratification by known cardiovascular risk factors
		  (hypertension, diabetes, and smoking status) also did not
		  modify the relation between fine-particulate matter and MI
		  onset. CONCLUSION: Although a very small effect cannot be
		  excluded, there was no consistent association between
		  ambient levels of fine-particulate matter and risk of MI
		  onset.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVES: We aim to assess the independent association
		  of particles, after controlling for gaseous pollutants,
		  with the risk of death among a cohort of patients with
		  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS:
		  Residents of Barcelona, aged over 35 years, who attended
		  emergency room services for COPD exacerbation from 1985 to
		  1989 and who died in the period 1990-1995 (n = 2305) were
		  selected. The analysis followed a case-crossover procedure
		  with ambidirectional controls. Air pollution exposure
		  (particulate matter <10 microm (PM(10)), ozone, nitrogen
		  dioxide and carbon monoxide) was measured at the city
		  monitoring stations. RESULTS: Levels of PM(10) (odds ratio
		  for the interquartile difference = 1.11, 95\% CI : 1.00-
		  1.24), but not gaseous pollutants, were associated with
		  mortality for all causes of death after adjusting for
		  meteorological variables and influenza epidemics. In the
		  two-pollutant models, the association of mortality with
		  PM(10) was not confounded by the inclusion of gases, while
		  the association of gaseous pollutants was notably reduced
		  after adjustment for particles. There was no interaction
		  between particles and gaseous pollutants. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Findings reinforce the deleterious role of urban particles
		  as a trigger of death in COPD patients, and suggest that
		  they are the major culprit among the air pollutants. The
		  role of other pollutants, if any, was additive and not
		  multiplicative.},

		  Patients in Barcelona aged over 14 years who died during
		  the period 1985-95 who had visited the emergency department
		  of one of the four largest hospitals in the city for asthma
		  during 1985-9 were included in the study (a total of 467

		  linkage of the cohort individuals with the Catalonia
		  mortality registry. Causes of death were based on the
		  underlying cause on the death certificate. Air pollution,

		  monitoring stations which provide an average for the entire
		  city. RESULTS: Nitrogen dioxide was associated with
		  mortality for all causes of death (adjusted odds ratio (OR)
		  for an increase of the interquartile range = 1.50, 95\%
		  confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 2.64) in asthmatic

		  also increased the risk of death in asthmatic patients (OR

		  association with particles, pollen, and spores was not

		  modest relative increase in risk for cases defined by
		  8-hour symptom onset for an interquartile-range increase in
		  PM2.5 at a 2-day lag (odds ratio=1.09, 95\% confidence
		  interval: 0.91, 1.30). A corresponding increase in risk was
		  not observed when admission date was used to define the
		  case period. A series of simulations based on study data
		  indicated that the study had adequate statistical power to
		  detect odds ratios of 1.2 or higher. Although overall
		  findings were not statistically significant, the
		  identification of case events defined by an 8-hour onset
		  period may be more relevant than either a 24-hour onset
		  period or the admission date for estimating harmful effects
		  of air pollutant exposure on cardiovascular health.},

		  techniques that are widely used for assessing the
		  short-term impact of ambient air pollution exposure on
		  health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The generalized linear mixed
		  model (GLMM) methodology is proposed here to study the
		  association between ambient air pollution and health
		  outcomes. Poisson random-effects models are applied to
		  analyze the clustered counts, where the groups of days,
		  determined by the triplet <day of week, month, year>, form
		  the clusters. The proposed technique uses a nested
		  structure for the clusters and allows random-effects for
		  hierarchical factors. A random intercept in the models
		  adjusts for different levels of counts among the clusters.
		  A fixed slope represents a common response to the exposure.
		  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results are
		  consistent with those generated by a classical approach
		  (for example the case-crossover technique). The GLMM
		  technique is a valid alternative methodology for studying
		  air health effects.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many studies have reported
		  increases in daily cardiovascular mortality and hospital
		  admissions associated with increases in levels of air
		  pollutants. However, little is known about the relationship
		  between hospital admissions for stroke and air pollution.
		  This study was undertaken to determine whether there is an
		  association between air pollution and hospital admissions
		  for stroke in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. METHODS: Data on a total
		  of 23 179 stroke admissions were obtained for the period
		  1997 through 2000. The relative risk of hospital admissions
		  was estimated with a case-crossover approach. RESULTS: In
		  the single-pollutant models, on warm days (> or =20 degrees
		  C), significant positive associations were found between
		  levels of PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 and both primary
		  intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke admissions. On
		  cool days (<20 degrees C), only CO levels and ischemic
		  stroke admissions were significantly associated. For the
		  2-pollutant models, PM10 and NO2 remained consistently and
		  significantly associated with admissions for both types of
		  stroke on warm days. We observed estimated relative risks
		  of 1.54 (95\% confidence interval [95\%], 1.31 to 1.81) and
		  1.56 (95\% CI, 1.32 to 1.84) for primary intracerebral
		  hemorrhage for each interquartile range increase in PM10
		  and NO2. The values for ischemic stroke were 1.46 (95\% CI,
		  1.32 to 1.61) and 1.55 (95\% CI, 1.40 to 1.71),
		  respectively. The effects of CO, SO2, and O3 were mostly
		  nonsignificant when either NO2 or PM10 was controlled for.
		  CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an association between
		  exposure to air pollution and hospital admissions for stroke.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many studies have reported
		  increases in daily cardiovascular mortality and hospital
		  admissions associated with increases in levels of air
		  pollutants. However, little is known about the relationship
		  between hospital admissions for stroke and air pollution.
		  This study was undertaken to determine whether there is an
		  association between air pollution and hospital admissions
		  for stroke in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. METHODS: Data on a total
		  of 23 179 stroke admissions were obtained for the period
		  1997 through 2000. The relative risk of hospital admissions
		  was estimated with a case-crossover approach. RESULTS: In
		  the single-pollutant models, on warm days (> or =20 degrees
		  C), significant positive associations were found between
		  levels of PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 and both primary
		  intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke admissions. On
		  cool days (<20 degrees C), only CO levels and ischemic
		  stroke admissions were significantly associated. For the
		  2-pollutant models, PM10 and NO2 remained consistently and
		  significantly associated with admissions for both types of
		  stroke on warm days. We observed estimated relative risks
		  of 1.54 (95\% confidence interval [95\%], 1.31 to 1.81) and
		  1.56 (95\% CI, 1.32 to 1.84) for primary intracerebral
		  hemorrhage for each interquartile range increase in PM10
		  and NO2. The values for ischemic stroke were 1.46 (95\% CI,
		  1.32 to 1.61) and 1.55 (95\% CI, 1.40 to 1.71),
		  respectively. The effects of CO, SO2, and O3 were mostly
		  nonsignificant when either NO2 or PM10 was controlled for.
		  CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an association between
		  exposure to air pollution and hospital admissions for stroke.},

		  stroke among the elderly according to stroke type, season,
		  and sex. Analyses are based on a total of 12,422 stroke
		  visits among those 65 years of age and older in Edmonton,
		  Canada between April 1, 1992 and March 31, 2002. Daily air
		  pollution levels for SO(2), NO(2), PM(2.5), PM(10), CO and

		  stations. Particulate matter data were only available from
		  1998 onwards. Conditional logistic regression was used to
		  estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95\% confidence
		  intervals in relation to an increase in the interquartile
		  range (IQR) of each pollutant. ORs were adjusted for the
		  effects of temperature and relative humidity. We found no
		  association between outdoor measures of air pollution and

		  observed between levels of air pollution and acute ischemic
		  stroke between April and September. During this season, the
		  ORs associated with an increase in the IQR of the 3-day
		  average for CO and NO(2) were 1.32 (95\% CI = 1.09-1.60)
		  and 1.26 (95\% CI = 1.09-1.46), respectively. CO exposures

		  increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke with ORs was 1.20
		  (95\% CI = 1.00-1.43). Our results suggest it is possible
		  that vehicular traffic, which produces increased levels of
		  NO(2) and CO, contributes to an increased incidence of

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association between short-term
		  elevations in ambient air particles and increased
		  cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well documented.
		  Ambient particles may similarly increase the risk of
		  stroke. METHODS: We evaluated the association between daily
		  levels of respirable particulate matter (aerodynamic
		  diameter < or =10 microm, PM10) and hospital admission for
		  ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among Medicare recipients
		  (age > or =65 years) in 9 US cities using a 2-stage
		  hierarchical model. In the first stage, we applied the
		  time-stratified case-crossover design to estimate the
		  effect of PM10 in each city. We used a 3-day unconstrained,
		  distributed lag model to simultaneously estimate the effect
		  of PM10 0 to 2 days before the admission day and controlled
		  for meteorological covariates in all of the models. In the
		  second stage, we used random-effects metaanalytic
		  techniques to combine the city-specific effect estimates.
		  RESULTS: Ischemic (n=155,503) and hemorrhagic (19,314)
		  stroke admissions were examined separately. For ischemic
		  stroke, an interquartile range increase in PM10 was
		  associated with a 1.03\% (95\% CI, 0.04\% to 2.04\%)
		  increase in admissions on the same day only. Similar
		  results were observed with CO, NO2, and SO2. For
		  hemorrhagic stroke, no association was observed with any
		  pollutant 0 to 2 days before admission. CONCLUSIONS: These
		  results suggest that elevations in ambient particles may
		  transiently increase the risk of ischemic, but not
		  hemorrhagic, stroke. Studies with more accurate assessment
		  of timing of stroke onset are necessary to confirm or
		  refute these findings.},

		  They also explored effect modification by age, gender, and
		  specific secondary diagnoses. During follow-up, 55,019
		  patients were admitted with a primary diagnosis of
		  congestive heart failure. In single-pollutant models,
		  particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <10

		  the most robust in two-pollutant models, remaining

  abstract	= {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Many studies have shown that ambient
		  particulate air pollution (PM) is associated with increased
		  risk of hospital admissions and deaths for cardiovascular
		  or respiratory causes around the world. In general these
		  have been analysed in association with PM(10) and ozone,
		  whereas PM(2.5) is now the particle measure of greatest
		  health and regulatory concern. And little has been
		  published on associations of hospital admissions and PM
		  components. DESIGN: This study analysed hospital admissions
		  for myocardial infarction (15 578 patients), and pneumonia
		  (24 857 patients) in associations with fine particulate air
		  pollution, black carbon (BC), ozone, nitrogen dioxide
		  (NO(2)), PM not from traffic, and carbon monoxide (CO) in
		  the greater Boston area for the years 1995-1999 using a
		  case-crossover analysis, with control days matched on
		  temperature. MAIN RESULTS: A significant association was
		  found between NO(2) (12.7\% change (95\% CI: 5.8, 18)),
		  PM(2.5) (8.6\% increase (95\% CI: 1.2, 15.4)), and BC
		  (8.3\% increase (95\% CI: 0.2, 15.8)) and the risk of
		  emergency myocardial infarction hospitalisation; and
		  between BC (11.7\% increase (95\% CI: 4.8, 17.4)), PM(2.5)
		  (6.5\% increase (95\% CI: 1.1, 11.4)), and CO (5.5\%
		  increase (95\% CI: 1.1, 9.5)) and the risk of pneumonia
		  hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of associations
		  seen for myocardial infarction and pneumonia (strongest
		  associations with NO(2), CO, and BC) suggests that traffic
		  exposure is primarily responsible for the association with
		  heart attacks.},

  abstract	= {A number of studies have recently shown an association
		  between particle concentrations in outdoor air and daily
		  mortality counts in urban locations. In the public health
		  interpretation of this evidence, a key issue is whether the
		  increased mortality associated with higher pollution levels
		  is restricted to very frail persons for whom life
		  expectancy is short in the absence of pollution. This
		  possibility has been termed the "harvesting hypothesis." We
		  present an approach to estimating the association between
		  pollution and mortality from times series data that is
		  resistant to short-term harvesting. The method is based in
		  the concept that harvesting alone creates associations only
		  at shorter time scales. We use frequency domain log-linear
		  regression to decompose the information about the
		  pollution-mortality association into distinct time scales,
		  and we then create harvesting-resistant estimates by
		  excluding the short-term information that is affected by
		  harvesting. We illustrate the methods with total suspended
		  particles and mortality counts from Philadelphia for
		  1974-1988. The total suspended particles-mortality
		  association in Philadelphia is inconsistent with the
		  harvesting-only hypothesis, and the harvesting-resistant
		  estimates of the total suspended particles relative risk
		  are actually larger-not smaller-than the ordinary
		  estimates.},

  abstract	= {Misclassification of exposure is a well-recognized
		  inherent limitation of epidemiologic studies of disease and
		  the environment. For many agents of interest, exposures
		  take place over time and in multiple locations; accurately
		  estimating the relevant exposures for an individual
		  participant in epidemiologic studies is often daunting,
		  particularly within the limits set by feasibility,
		  participant burden, and cost. Researchers have taken steps
		  to deal with the consequences of measurement error by
		  limiting the degree of error through a study's design,
		  estimating the degree of error using a nested validation
		  study, and by adjusting for measurement error in
		  statistical analyses. In this paper, we address measurement
		  error in observational studies of air pollution and health.
		  Because measurement error may have substantial implications
		  for interpreting epidemiologic studies on air pollution,
		  particularly the time-series analyses, we developed a
		  systematic conceptual formulation of the problem of
		  measurement error in epidemiologic studies of air pollution
		  and then considered the consequences within this
		  formulation. When possible, we used available relevant data
		  to make simple estimates of measurement error effects. This
		  paper provides an overview of measurement errors in linear
		  regression, distinguishing two extremes of a
		  continuum-Berkson from classical type errors, and the
		  univariate from the multivariate predictor case. We then
		  propose one conceptual framework for the evaluation of
		  measurement errors in the log-linear regression used for
		  time-series studies of particulate air pollution and
		  mortality and identify three main components of error. We
		  present new simple analyses of data on exposures of
		  particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter from
		  the Particle Total Exposure Assessment Methodology Study.
		  Finally, we summarize open questions regarding measurement
		  error and suggest the kind of additional data necessary to
		  address them.},

		  is known about the modification of this association by
		  factors measured at the individual level. The authors
		  examined this question in a case-crossover study of 20 US
		  cities. Mortality events (1.9 million) were obtained for
		  nonaccidental, respiratory, heart disease, and stroke
		  mortality between 1989 and 2000. PM(10) concentrations were

		  authors examined the modification of the PM(10)-mortality
		  association by sociodemographics, location of death,
		  season, and secondary diagnoses. They found different
		  patterns of PM(10)-mortality associations by gender and age
		  but no differences by race. The level of education was
		  inversely related to the risk of mortality associated with
		  PM(10). PM(10)-related, out-of-hospital deaths were more
		  likely than were in-hospital deaths, as were those
		  occurring during spring/fall versus summer/winter. A
		  secondary diagnosis of diabetes modified the effect of
		  PM(10) for respiratory and stroke mortality. Pneumonia was
		  a positive effect modifier for deaths from all causes and
		  stroke, while secondary stroke modified the effects for
		  all-cause and respiratory deaths. The findings suggest that
		  more attention must be paid to population characteristics
		  to identify greater likelihood of exposures and
		  susceptibility and, as a result, to improve policy making
		  for air pollution standards.},
