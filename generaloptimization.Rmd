# General Optimization

```

The general optimization problem can be stated as follows. Given a fiunction $f: \mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, we want to find $\min_{x\in S}f(x)$, where $S\subset\mathbb{R}^k$. The general approach to solving this problem that we will discuss is called a *line search method*. With line search methods, given $f$ and a current estimate $x_n$ of the location of the minimum, we want to 

1. Choose a direction $p_n$ in $k$-dimensional space;

2. Choose a step length in the direction $p_n$, usually by solving $\min_{\alpha>0} f(x_n + \alpha p_n)$ to get $\alpha_n$

3. Update our estimate with $x_{n+1} = x_n + \alpha_n p_n$.

Clearly then, with line search methods, the two questions one must answer are how should we choose the direction? and how far should we step? Almost all line search approaches provide variations on the answers to those two questions.

Care must be taken in addressing the problems involved with line search methods because typically one must assume that the size of the parameter space is large (i.e. $k$ is large). Therefore, one of constraints for all methods is minimizing the amount of computation that needs to be done due to the large parameter space. Efficiency with respect to memory (storage of data or parameters) and computation time is key.




## Steepest Descent

Perhaps the most obvious direction to choose when attempting to minimize a function $f$ starting at $x_n$ is the direction of *steepest descent*, or $-f^\prime(x_n)$. This is the direction that is orthogonal to the contours of $f$ at the point $x_n$ and hence is the direction in which $f$ is changing most rapidly at $x_n$.

![Direction of steepest descent.](image/steepestdescent.png)

The updating procedure for a steepest descent algorithm, given the current estimate $x_n$, is then

\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \alpha_n f^\prime(x_n)
\]

While it might seem logical to always go in the direction of steepest descent, it can occasionally lead to some problems. In particular, when certain parameters are highly correlated with each other, the steepest descent algorithm can require many steps to reach the minimum. 

The figure below illustrates a function whose contours are highly correlated and hence elliptical. 

![Steepest descent with highly correlated parameters.](image/steepestdescent2.png)


Depending on the starting value, the steepest descent algorithm could take many steps to wind its way towards the minimum. 


### Example: Multivariate Normal

One can use steepest descent to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean in a multivariate Normal density, given a sample of data. However, when the data are highly correlated, as they are in the simulated example below, the log-likelihood surface can be come difficult to optimize. In such cases,  a very narrow ridge develops in the log-likelihood that can be difficult for the steepest descent algorithm to navigate.

In the example below, we actually compute the *negative* log-likelihood because the algorith is designed to *minimize* functions.

```{r}
set.seed(2017-08-10)
mu <- c(1, 2)
S <- rbind(c(1, .9), c(.9, 1))
x <- MASS::mvrnorm(500, mu, S)
nloglike <- function(mu1, mu2) {
        dmv <- mvtnorm::dmvnorm(x, c(mu1, mu2), S, log = TRUE)
        -sum(dmv)
}
nloglike <- Vectorize(nloglike, c("mu1", "mu2"))
nx <- 40
ny <- 40
xg <- seq(-5, 5, len = nx)
yg <- seq(-5, 6, len = ny)
g <- expand.grid(xg, yg)
nLL <- nloglike(g[, 1], g[, 2])
z <- matrix(nLL, nx, ny)
par(mar = c(4.5, 4.5, 1, 1))
contour(xg, yg, z, nlevels = 40, xlab = expression(mu[1]), 
        ylab = expression(mu[2]))
abline(h = 0, v = 0, lty = 2)
```

Note that in the figure above the surface is highly stretched and that the minimum $(1, 2)$ lies in the middle of a narrow valley. For the steepest descent algorithm we will start at the point $(-5, -2)$ and track the path of the algorithm. 

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
norm <- function(x) x / sqrt(sum(x^2))
Sinv <- solve(S)  ## I know I said not to do this!
step1 <- function(mu, alpha = 1) {
        D <- sweep(x, 2, mu, "-")
        score <- colSums(D) %>% norm
        mu + alpha * drop(Sinv %*% score)
}
steep <- function(mu, n = 10, ...) {
        results <- vector("list", length = n)
        for(i in seq_len(n)) {
                results[[i]] <- step1(mu, ...)
                mu <- results[[i]]
        }
        results
}
m <- do.call("rbind", steep(c(-5, -2), 8))
m <- rbind(c(-5, -2), m)

par(mar = c(4.5, 4.5, 1, 1))
contour(xg, yg, z, nlevels = 40, xlab = expression(mu[1]), 
        ylab = expression(mu[2]))
abline(h = 0, v = 0, lty = 2)
points(m, pch = 20, type = "b")
```

We can see that the path of the algorthm is rather winding as it traverses the narrow valley. Now, we have fixed the step-length in this case, which is probably not optimal. However, one can still see that the algorithm has some difficulty navigating the surface because the direction of steepest descent does not take one directly towards the minimum ever.


## The Newton Direction 

Given a current best estimate $x_n$, we can approximate $f$ with a quadratic polynomial. For some small $p$,

\[
f(x_n + p)
\approx
f(x_n) + p^\prime f^\prime(x_n) + \frac{1}{2}p^\prime f^{\prime\prime}(x_n)p.
\]

If we minimize the right hand side with respect to $p$, we obtain 
\[
p_n = f^{\prime\prime}(x_n)^{-1}[-f^\prime(x_n)]
\]
which we can think of as the steepest descent direction "twisted" by the inverse of the Hessian matrix $f^{\prime\prime}(x_n)^{-1}$. Newton's method has a "natural" step length of $1$, so that the updating procedure is

\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - f^{\prime\prime}(x_n)^{-1}f^\prime(x_n).
\]

Newton's method makes a quadratic approximation to the target function $f$ at each step of the algorithm. This follows the "optimization transfer" principle mentioned earlier, whereby we take a complex function $f$, replace it with a simpler function $g$ that is easier to optimize, and then optimize the simpler function repeatedly until convergence to the solution.

We can visualize how Newton's method makes its quadratic approximation to the target function easily in one dimension. 


```{r}
curve(-dnorm(x), -2, 3, lwd = 2, ylim = c(-0.55, .1))
xn <- -1.2
abline(v = xn, lty = 2)
axis(3, xn, expression(x[n]))
g <- function(x) {
        -dnorm(xn) + (x-xn) * xn * dnorm(xn) - 0.5 * (x-xn)^2 * (dnorm(xn) - xn * (xn * dnorm(xn)))
}
curve(g, -2, 3, add = TRUE, col = 4)
op <- optimize(g, c(0, 3))
abline(v = op$minimum, lty = 2)
axis(3, op$minimum, expression(x[n+1]))


```

In the above figure, the next iterate, $x_{n+1}$ is actually further away from the minimum than our previous iterate $x_n$. The quadratic approximation that Newton's method makes to $f$ is not guaranteed to be good at every point of the function. 

This shows an important "feature" of Newton's method, which is that it is not *monotone*. The successive iterations that Newton's method produces are not guaranteed to be improvements in the sense that each iterate is closer to the truth. The tradeoff here is that while Newton's method is very fast (quadratic convergence), it can be unstable at times. Monotone algorithms (like the EM algorithm that we discuss later) that always produce improvements, are more stable, but generally converge at slower rates. 

In the next figure, however, we can see that the solution provided by the next approximation, $x_{n+2}$, is indeed quite close to the true minimum.





```{r}
curve(-dnorm(x), -2, 3, lwd = 2, ylim = c(-0.55, .1))
xn <- -1.2
op <- optimize(g, c(0, 3))
abline(v = op$minimum, lty = 2)
axis(3, op$minimum, expression(x[n+1]))

xn <- op$minimum
curve(g, -2, 3, add = TRUE, col = 4)
op <- optimize(g, c(0, 3))
abline(v = op$minimum, lty = 2)
axis(3, op$minimum, expression(x[n+2]))
```


It is worth noting that in the rare event that $f$ is in fact a quadratic polynomial, Newton's method will converge in a single step because the quadratic approximation that it makes to $f$ will be exact. 

### Generalized Linear Models

The generalized linear model is an extension of the standard linear model to allow for non-Normal response distributions. The distributions used typically come from an exponential family whose density functions share some common characteristics. With a GLM, we typical present it as $y_i\sim p(y_i\mid\mu_i)$, where $p$ is an exponential family distribution, $\mathbb{E}[y_i]=\mu_i$, 
\[
g(\mu_i) = x_i^\prime\beta,
\]
where $g$ is a nonlinear link function, and $\text{Var}(y_i) = V(\mu)$ where $V$ is a known variance function.

Unlike the standard linear model, the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter vector $\beta$ cannot be obtained in closed form, so an iterative algorithm must be used to obtain the estimate. The traditional algorithm used is the Fisher scoring algorithm. This algorithm uses a linear approximation to the nonlinear link function $g$, which can be written as
\[
g(y_i)\approx g(\mu_i) + (y_i-\mu_i)g^\prime(\mu_i).
\]
The typical notation of GLMs refers to $z_i=g(\mu_i) + (y_i-\mu_i)g^\prime(\mu_i)$ as the *working response*. The Fisher scoring algorithm then works as follows.

1. Start with $\hat{\mu}_i$, some initial value.

2. Compute $z_i = g(\hat{\mu}_i) + (y_i-\hat{\mu}_i)g^\prime(\hat{\mu}_i)$.

3. Given the $n\times 1$ vector of working responses $z$ and the $n\times p$  predictor matrix $X$ we compute a weighted regression of $z$ on $X$ to get 
\[
\beta_n = (X^\prime WX)^{-1}X^\prime Wz
\]
where $W$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements
\[
w_{ii} = \left[g^\prime(\mu_i)^2V(\mu_i)\right]^{-1}.
\]

4. Given $\beta_n$, we can recompute $\hat{\mu}_i=g^{-1}(x_i^\prime\beta_n)$ and go to 2.

Note that in Step 3 above, the weights are simply the inverses of the variance of $z_i$, i.e. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{Var}(z_i) 
& = & 
\text{Var}(g(\mu_i) + (y_i-\mu_i)g^\prime(\mu_i))\\
& = & 
\text{Var}((y_i-\mu_i)g^\prime(\mu_i))\\
& = & V(\mu_i)g^\prime(\mu_i)^2
\end{eqnarray*}
Naturally, when doing a weighted regression, we would weight by the inverse of the variances.


#### Example: Poisson Regression

For a Poisson regression, we have $y_i\sim\text{Poisson}(\mu_i)$ where $g(\mu) = \log\mu_i = x_i^\prime\beta$ because the log is the canonical link function for the Poisson distribution. We also have $g^\prime(\mu_i) = \frac{1}{\mu_i}$ and $V(\mu_i) = \mu_i$. Therefore, the Fisher scoring algorithm is

1. Initialize $\hat{\mu}_i$, perhaps using $y_i + 1$ (to avoid zeros).

2. Let $z_i = \log\hat{\mu}_i + (y_i-\hat{\mu}_i)\frac{1}{\hat{\mu}_i}$

3. Regression $z$ on $X$ using the weights
\[
w_{ii} = \left[\frac{1}{\hat{\mu}_i^2}\hat{\mu}_i\right]^{-1} = \hat{\mu}_i.
\]

Using the Poisson regression example, we can draw a connection between the usual Fisher scoring algorithm for fitting GLMs and Newton's method. Recall that if $\ell(\beta)$ is the log-likelihood as a function of the regression paramters $\beta$, then the Newton updating scheme is
\[
\beta_{n+1} = \beta_n + \ell^{\prime\prime}(\beta_n)^{-1}[-\ell^\prime(\beta_n)].
\]

The log-likelihoood for a Poisson regression model can be written in vector/matrix form as
\[
\ell(\beta) = y^\prime X\beta - \exp(X\beta)^\prime\mathbf{1}
\]
where the exponential is taken component-wise on the vector $X\beta$. The gradient function is
\[
\ell^\prime(\beta) = X^\prime y - X^\prime \exp(X\beta)
=
X^\prime(y-\mu)
\]
and the Hessian is
\[
\ell^{\prime\prime}(\beta) = -X^\prime W X
\]
where $W$ is a diagonal matrix with the values $w_{ii} = \exp(x_i^\prime\beta)$ on the diagonal. The Newton iteration is then
\begin{eqnarray*}
\beta_{n+1} 
& = & 
\beta_n + (-X^\prime WX)^{-1}(-X^\prime(y-\mu))\\
& = & 
\beta_n + (X^\prime WX)^{-1}XW(z - X\beta_n)\\
& = &
(X^\prime WX)^{-1}X^\prime Wz + \beta_n - (X^\prime WX)^{-1}X^\prime WX\beta_n\\
& = &
(X^\prime WX)^{-1}X^\prime Wz
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore the iteration is exactly the same as the Fisher scoring algorithm in this case. In general, Newton's method and Fisher scoring will coincide with any generalized linear model using an exponential family with a canonical link function. 


### Newton's Method in R

The `nlm()` function in R implements Newton's method for minimizing a function given a vector of starting values. By default, one does not need to supply the gradient or Hessian functions; they will be estimated numerically by the algorithm. However, for the purposes of improving accuracy of the algorithm, both the gradient and Hessian can be supplied as attributes of the target function. 


As an example, we will use the `nlm()` function to fit a simple logistic regression model for binary data. This model specifies that $y_i\sim\text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$ where
\[
\log\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} = \beta_0 + x_i \beta_1
\]
and the goal is to estimate $\beta$ via maximum likelihood. Given the assumed Bernoulli distribution, we can write the log-likelihood for a single observation as
\begin{eqnarray*}
\log L(\beta) & = & \log\left\{\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{y_i}(1-p_i)^{1-y_i}\right\}\\
& = & 
\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\log p_i + (1-y_i)\log(1-p_i)\\
& = & 
\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\log\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}+\log(1-p_i)\\
& = &
\sum_{i=1}^n y_i(\beta_0 + x_i\beta_1) + \log\left(\frac{1}{1+e^{(\beta_0 + x_i\beta_1)}}\right)\\
& = & 
\sum_{i=1}^n y_i(\beta_0 + x_i\beta_1) -\log\left(1+e^{(\beta_0 + x_i\beta_1)}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
If we take the very last line of the above derivation and take a single element inside the sum, we have
\[
\ell_i(\beta)
=
y_i(\beta_0 + x_i\beta_1) -\log\left(1+e^{(\beta_0 + x_i\beta_1)}\right)
\]
We will need the gradient and Hessian of this with respect to $\beta$. Because the sum and the derivative are exchangeable, we can then sum each of the individual gradients and Hessians to get the full gradient and Hessian for the entire sample, so that
\[
\ell^\prime(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n\ell_i^\prime(\beta)
\]
and
\[
\ell^{\prime\prime}(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \ell_i^{\prime\prime}(\beta).
\]
Now, taking the gradient and Hessian of the above expression may be mildly inconvenient, but it is far from impossible. Nevertheless, R provides an automated way to do symbolic differentiation so that manual work can be avoided. The `deriv()` function computes the gradient and Hessian of an expression symbolically so that it can be used in minimization routines. It cannot compute gradients of arbitrary expressions, but it it does support a wide range of common statistical functions. 

#### Example: Trends in p-values Over Time

The `tidypvals` package written by Jeff Leek contains datasets taken from the literature collecting p-values associated with various publications along with some information about those publications (i.e. journal, year, DOI). One question that comes up is whether there has been any trend over time in the claimed statistical significance of publications, where "statistical significance" is defined as having a p-value less than $0.05$.

The `tidypvals` package is available from GitHub and can be installed using the `install_github()` function in the `remotes` package.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("jtleek/tidypvals")
```

Once installed, we will make use of the `jager2014` dataset. In particular, we are interseted in creating an indicator of whether a p-value is less than $0.05$ and regressing it on the `year` variable. 

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(tidypvals)
library(dplyr)
jager <- mutate(tidypvals::jager2014, 
                pvalue = as.numeric(as.character(pvalue)),
                y = ifelse(pvalue < 0.05 
                           | (pvalue == 0.05 & operator == "lessthan"), 
                           1, 0),
                x = year - 2000) %>%
        tbl_df
```

Note here that we have subtracted the year 2000 off of the `year` variable so that $x=0$ corresponds to `year == 2000`. 

Next we compute the gradient and Hessian of the negative log-likelihood with respect to $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ using the `deriv()` function. Below, we specify `function.arg = TRUE` in the call to `deriv()` because we want `deriv()` to return a *function* whose arguments are `b0` and `b1`.

```{r}
nll_one <- deriv(~ -(y * (b0 + x * b1) - log(1 + exp(b0 + b1 * x))),
             c("b0", "b1"), function.arg = TRUE, hessian = TRUE)
nll_one
```

The function `nll_one()` produced by `deriv()` evaluates the negative log-likelihood for each data point. The output from `nll_one()` will have attributes `"gradient"` and `"hessian"` which represent the gradient and Hessian, respectively. For example, using the data from the `jager` dataset, we can evaluate the negative log-likelihood at $\beta_0=0, \beta_1=0$.

```{r}
x <- jager$x
y <- jager$y
str(nll_one(0, 0))
```

The `nll_one()` function evaluates the negative log-likelihood at each data point, but does not sum the points up as would be required to evaluate the full negative log-likelihood. Therefore, we will write a separate function that does that for the negative log-likelihood, gradient, and Hessian.

```{r}
nll <- function(b) {
        v <- nll_one(b[1], b[2])
        f <- sum(v)                                     ## log-likelihood
        gr <- colSums(attr(v, "gradient"))              ## gradient vector
        hess <- apply(attr(v, "hessian"), c(2, 3), sum) ## Hessian matrix
        attributes(f) <- list(gradient = gr, hessian = hess)
        f
}
```

Now, we can evaluate the full negative log-likelihood with the `nll()` function. Note that `nll()` takes a single numeric vector as input as this is what the `nlm()` function is expecting.

```{r}
nll(c(0, 0))
```
 
 
Using $\beta_0=0,\beta_1=0$ as the initial value, we can call `nlm()` to minimize the negative log-likelihood.
 
```{r}
res <- nlm(nll, c(0, 0))
res
```

Note first in the output that there is a `code` with the value $4$ and that the number of iterations is 100. Whenever the number of iterations in an optimization algorithm is a nice round number, the chances are good that it it some preset iteration limit. This in turn usually means the algorithm didn't converge. 

In the help for `nlm()` we also learn that the `code` value of $4$ means "iteration limit exceeded", which is generally not good. Luckily, the solution is simple: we can increase the iteration limit and let the algorithm run longer.

```{r}
res <- nlm(nll, c(0, 0), iterlim = 1000)
res
```

Here we see that the number of iterations used was 260, which is well below the iteration limit. Now we get `code` equal to $2$ which means that "successive iterates within tolerance, current iterate is probably solution". Sounds like good news!

Lastly, most optimization algorithms have an option to scale your parameter values so that they roughly vary on the same scale. If your target function has paramters that vary on wildly different scales, this can cause a practical problem for the computer (it's not a problem for the theory). The way to deal with this in `nlm()` is to use the `typsize` arguemnt, which is a vector equal in length to the parameter vector which provides the relative sizes of the parameters. 

Here, I give `typsize = c(1, 0.1)`, which indicates to `nlm()` that the first paramter, $\beta_0$, should be roughly $10$ times larger than the second parameter, $\beta_1$ when the target function is at its minimum.

```{r}
res <- nlm(nll, c(0, 0), iterlim = 1000,
           typsize = c(1, 0.1))
res
```

Running this call to `nlm()` you'll notice that the solution is the same but the number of iterations is actually much less than before (`r res$iterations` iterations) which means the algorithm ran faster. Generally speaking, scaling the parameter vector appropriately (if possible) improves the performance of all optimization algorithms and in my experience is almost always a good idea. The specific values given to the `typsize` argument are not important; rather their relationships to each other (i.e. orders of magnitude) are what matter.


## Quasi-Newton

Quasi-Newton methods arise from the desire to use something like Newton's method for its speed but without having to compute the Hessian matrix each time. The idea is that if the Newton iteration is
\[
\theta_{n+1} = \theta_n-f^{\prime\prime}(\theta_n)^{-1}f^\prime(\theta_n)
\]
is there some other matrix that we can use to replace either $f^{\prime\prime}(\theta_n)$ or $f^{\prime\prime}(\theta_n)^{-1}$? That is can we use a revised iteration,
\[
\theta_{n+1} = \theta_n-B_n^{-1}f^\prime(\theta_n)
\]
where $B$ is simpler to compute but still allows the algorith to converge quickly?

This is a challenging problem because $f^{\prime\prime}(\theta_n)$ gives us a lot of information about the surface of $f$ at $\theta_n$ and throwing out this information results in, well, a severe loss of information. 

The idea with Quasi-Newton is to find a solution $B_n$ to the problem
\[
f^\prime(\theta_n)-f^\prime(\theta_{n-1})
=
B_n (\theta_n-\theta_{n-1}).
\]
The equation above is sometimes referred to as the secant equation. Note first that this requires us to store two values, $\theta_n$ and $\theta_{n-1}$. Also, in one dimension, the solution is trivial: we can simply divide the left-hand-side by $\theta_n-\theta_{n-1}$. However, in more than one dimension, there exists an infinite number of solutions and we need some way to constrain the problem to arrive at a sensible answer.

The key to Qusi-Newton approaches in general is that while we initially may not have much information about $f$, with each iteration we obtain just a little bit more. Specifically, we learn more about the Hessian matrix through successive differences in $f^\prime$. Therefore, with each iteration we can incorporate this newly obtained information into our estimate of the Hessian matrix. The constraints placed on the matrix $B_n$ is that it be *symmetric* and that it be close to $B_{n-1}$. These constraints can be satisfied by update $B_n$ via the addition of rank one matrices.

If we let $y_n = f^\prime(\theta_n)-f^\prime(\theta_{n-1})$ and $s_n = \theta_n-\theta_{n-1}$, then the secant equation is $y_n = B_ns_n$. One updating procedures for $B_n$

\[
B_{n} = B_{n-1} + \frac{y_ny_n^\prime}{y_n^\prime s_n}
- \frac{B_{n-1}s_ns_n^\prime B_{n-1}^\prime}{s_n^\prime B_{n-1}s_n}
\]

The above updating procedure was developed by Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno (BFGS). An analogous approach, which solves the following secant equation, $H_n y_n = s_n$ was proposed by Davidon, Fletcher, and Powell (DFP). 

Note that in the case of the BFGS method, we actually use $B_n^{-1}$ in the Newton update. However, it is not necessary to solve for $B_{n}$ and then invert it directly. We can directly update $B_{n-1}^{-1}$ to produce $B_{n}^{-1}$ via the [Sherman-Morrison update formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman–Morrison_formula). This formula allows us to generate the new inverse matrix by using the previous inverse and some matrix multiplication. 

### Quasi-Newton Methods in R






## Conjugate Gradient



## Coordinate Descent

The idea of coordinate descent methods is simple. If $f$ is a $k$-dimensional function, we can minimize $f$ by successively minimizing each of the individual dimensions of $f$ in a cyclic fashion, while holding the values of $f$ in the other dimensions fixed. This approach is sometimes referred to as cyclic coordinate descent. The primary advantage of this approach is that it takes an arbitrarily complex $k$-dimensional problem and reduces it to a collection of $k$ one-dimensional problems. The disadvantage is that convergence can often be painfully slow, particularly in problems where $f$ is not well-behaved. In statistics, a popular version of this algorithm is known as *backfitting* and is used to fit generalized additive models.
