# Setup {-}

```{r,include=FALSE}
pkgs <- sort(readLines("_R_package_list.txt"))
pkgstr <- paste("`", pkgs, "`", sep = "", collapse = ", ")
installstr <- paste0("install.packages(c(", 
                     paste("\"", pkgs, "\"", sep = "", 
                           collapse = ", "),
                     "))")
```
This book makes use of the following R packages, which should be installed to take full advantage of the examples. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,comment=NA}
writeLines(pkgs)
```

You can install all of these packages with the following code:

```{r,echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
cat(installstr, "\n")
```
