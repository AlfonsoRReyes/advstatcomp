# Welcome {-}

The book covers material taught in the Johns Hopkins Biostatistics Advanced Statistical Computing course.

## Stay in Touch! {-}

If you are interested in hearing more from me about things that I'm working on (books, data
science courses, podcast, etc.), you can do two things:

* First, I encourage you to join the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab mailing list](https://tinyletter.com/jhudatascience). On this list I send out updates of my own activities as well as occasional comments on data science current events. You can also find out what my co-conspirators Jeff Leek and Brian Caffo are up to because sometimes they do really cool stuff.
* Second, I have a regular podcast called [Not So Standard Deviations](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast) that I co-host with Dr. Hilary Parker, a Data Scientist at Stitch Fix. On this podcast, Hilary and I talk about the craft of data science and discuss common issues and problems in analyzing data. We'll also compare how data science is approached in both academia and industry contexts and discuss the latest industry trends.  You can listen to recent episodes on our SoundCloud page or you can subscribe to it in [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/not-so-standard-deviations/id1040614570) or your favorite podcasting app.

For those of you who purchased a **printed copy** of this book, I encourage you to go to the Leanpub web site and [obtain the e-book version](), which is available for free. The reason is that I will occasionally update the book with new material and readers who purchase the e-book version are entitled to free updates (this is unfortunately not yet possible with printed books) and will be notified when they are released.

Thanks again for purchasing this book and please do stay in touch!



## Setup {-}

```{r,include=FALSE}
pkgs <- sort(readLines("_R_package_list.txt"))
pkgstr <- paste("`", pkgs, "`", sep = "", collapse = ", ")
installstr <- paste0("install.packages(c(", 
                     paste("\"", pkgs, "\"", sep = "", 
                           collapse = ", "),
                     "))")
```
This book makes use of the following R packages, which should be installed to take full advantage of the examples. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,comment=NA}
writeLines(pkgs)
```

You can install all of these packages with the following code:

```{r,echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
cat(installstr, "\n")
```
